This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true}],"companiesCount":1,"creditsPerTransaction":0,"view":true},

It offers, among others: new email accounts, free web hosting, and domain name registration. The list of its 130 services includes the national and international headlines in the Polish language followed by business news, sports, motorization and new technologies, as well as online games, blogs, chat rooms, internet forums and a shopping arcade, not to mention the streaming radio and Internet television channels. Interia hosts one of Polish online encyclopedias, the Encyklopedia Internautica and the thematic catalogue of websites. It features also the weather info, astrology, virtual greeting cards popular locally, and hundreds of online chats (czaterie) with the \"KidProtect\" option. The portal was created by the ComArch Management IT corporation (listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange) and the RMF FM radio. The Interia S.A. company is almost wholly owned by RMF FM parent company, the German multimedia conglomerate Bauer Media Group, represented by Witold Woniak. Bauer bought 96,6% of its shares in September 2008 and controls 99% of its vote. Due to its availability and relaxed internal policy, the free hosting service Interia has become a popular spam redirector in recent time. Spammers frequently link to its free sub-domains in their spam campaigns to avoid having their messages easily detected as junk and automatically blocked. Although, there are many legitimate webpages as well as services listed at Interia (or perhaps because of it), spammers sign up for its free accounts in volumes similar to GeoCities (Yahoo!-owned service), although their perennial favorite seems to be Google's Blogspot based in the US. The redirect pages created by spammers at Interia link only to spamvertising.","companyPhone":"+48 126462700","companyRevenueIn000s":58998,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"retail.gifts","displayName":"Flowers, Gifts & Specialty Stores","isPrimary":false,"score":30},{"name":"retail","displayName":"Retail","isPrimary":false,"score":30}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isMasked":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Group Chief Executive Officer","jobTitle":"Group Chief Executive Officer","isPast":"False","personID":8774407313,"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Richter","location":{"City":"Brest","State":"Brest","CountryCode":"Belarus"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-11-28","lastMentioned":"2022-11-28","confidenceScore":90,"name":"Pawel Richter","score":0,"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawel-richter-b97934209"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Group Chief Executive Officer","organizationName":"Interia.pl Group"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-11-23","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true}],"companiesCount":1,"creditsPerTransaction":0,"view":true},

Since its launch in 2012, the Bounce concept has been widely regarded by the industry as a game-changer in social entertainment venues, which combines three elements of hospitality: bar, restaurant and entertainment activity - all set against award-winning design and the highest standard of fit out. Bounce is the world's leading concept to offer this immersive experience, taking the humble Ping Pong table from the back corner of a bar to become the main offering of the venue, while creating an intricately considered and currently unrivalled leisure experience. Bounce Farringdon, the flagship venue quickly established itself as one of London's most iconic and most talked about venues and has hosted games for Elle Macpherson, Gwyneth Paltrow & Kevin Spacey to name but a few.

As weve grown, so has our menu and our community, yet our values have stayed the same. We take the time to make our bread, pastries, cakes, breakfasts and lunches as we always have with care, by hand and according to the season so that we dont need to compromise on what we eat, whether were on the go, or taking time out in one of our bakeries. Everyone is welcome in our bakeries. We believe in the power of community, in helping those around us and living as sustainably as possible. We insist on the finest ingredients, supporting small businesses wherever we can, and though were always innovating, our baking is based on time-honoured techniques and our decades-old starters. Nothing gives us as much pleasure as a freshly baked, lovingly crafted loaf. We bake by hand with natural ingredients, and whilst we are ordinary people, we want to make extraordinary things. We want to play our part to bring humanity back into the food world, back to local communities. We cant imagine doing anything more gratifying than baking our, and your, bread. In the 1990s, Gail Mejia brought the best bakers in town together to bake for Londons top chefs and restaurants. Our wholesale business, The Bread Factory, which was named ironically because it has always exclusively specialised in handmade, traditional artisan baking, continues to thrive, serving top restaurants and discerning customers. Our first GAILs bakery opened in Londons Hampstead High Street in 2005. Today, we have 69 bakeries in neighbourhoods in and around London, Oxford, Brighton and beyond. We bake fresh, handmade bread, pastries and cakes every day, served with our carefully-sourced house blend specialty coffee. We take great pleasure in using the best ingredients we can find for food and drink, using seasonal ingredients from suppliers we trust. Though weve grown over the years, our philosophy has remained the same: to make good food that people love, and create bakeries that people want to keep coming back to.

Sticks'n'Sushi was founded 18 years ago by brothers Jens and Kim Rahbek and Thor Andersen.Taking inspiration from their half-Japanese, half-Danish background, they created a unique cuisine that combines two culinary traditions. This made Sticks'n'Sushi a dynamic and innovative force on the Danish gourmet scene. The concept took off with overwhelming speed and success. The freshness and the high quality of the food and the relaxed atmosphere made Sticks'n'Sushi one of Copenhagens busiest restaurants almost overnight. Today there are ten Sticks'n'Sushi restaurants in Copenhagen, with more planned. From the very beginning, Sticks'n'Sushi has refused to be just another restaurant. The intention was always to be one of a kind. Today Sticks'n'Sushi is just that. Sticks'n'Sushi is known for its great food and progressive attitude and is one of the most innovative restaurants in the industry.

To the south lies the coastal villages and resorts of Scarborough , Filey and Bridlington . All these are well within a short drive. The nearest city inland is York. From the old town, 199 steps lead up to the parish church of St. Mary, whose churchyard on Whitbys East Cliff gave Bram Stoker the inspiration to write his world famous book, Dracula . The towns skyline is dominated by the ruins of St. Hildas Abbey, high on the East Cliff. Spreading below in the old town, a maze of alleyways and narrow streets run down to the busy quayside. The town has produced its own century explorer and voyager who had set sail in the Bark Endeavour from the harbour, the outstanding father and son whaling masters of the Scoresby family and pioneer photographer, Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. Whitby is a seaside town, port and civil parish in the Borough of Scarborough and English county of North Yorkshire. Whitby is situated on the east coast of Yorkshire facing the North Sea in a deep valley at the mouth of the River Esk. It has been a bridging point since at least medieval times and several bridges have spanned the river. The current bridge, built in 1908, is a swing bridge with a 75-foot span that separates the upper and lower harbours. The town is surrounded on its landward sides by the moorland of the North York Moors National Park and the North Sea abuts it on the seaward side. The coastal areas are designated part of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Heritage Coast. This stretch of coast, known as the Dinosaur Coast, the Fossil Coast or the Jurassic Coast, is around 35 miles long, stretching from Staithes in the north, to Flamborough Head in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

From 2000 through 2012, my father's teas were well received across North America as some of the finest black teas each year. In 2012 both my parents were assassinated in their tea garden in Assam. Assam Tea Company had to be either shut down or the company had to reinvent itself. Assam Tea Company reinvented itself. We continued to focus on importing and distributing Assam black teas. Today we have a sister company in Assam, through which we buy freshly harvested black tea every week and ship them to US & Canada via air and sea consignments. Today we also have a growing menu of blends using teas, herbs, spices and organic-compliant natural flavors. Our blends cover the entire range from Earl Greys to Chais and those without any extracts at all, Spa Blends. I have personally designed each and every blend over the last 17 years, and I continue to spend my days cupping teas to buy, and blending teas and herbs for my clients. I focus on using organic teas and herbs, and botanical extracts that are without any preservatives and synthetic solvents. These flavors derived from nature have a short shelf life, compared to synthetic flavors with preservatives, but once you taste them you will agree with me - they taste much better! Assam Tea Company mainly caters to coffee roasters, tea distributors, small brands, restaurants, coffee shops and other food service operators. We also have a strong following among tea drinkers who loves the taste of freshly harvested pure Assam black teas! From retired teachers to tea snobs from budding tea-entrepreneurs to famous restaurateurs, we supply the finest teas to those who focus on drinking and serving fresh, wholesome teas.

Not so long ago, tequila girls, cheap shots and greasy tortilla chips were images that sprang to mind when 'Mexican' was done in Britain. At Wahaca we shook things up a bit and started doing things a little differently. Living in Mexico, running bars out there and having time to explore its amazing cuisine made me fall in love with the incredible vibrancy and freshness of real Mexican food. After a quick spin through the Masterchef kitchens I teamed up with Mark to create Wahaca's menu, constantly looking to the markets of Mexico for inspiration and recreating their wonderful food over here. We've worked hard to match the flavours of Mexico with ingredients that we can get hold of to create a constantly evolving, seasonal menu with ingredients sourced as locally as possibly, or grown and transported with care for the environment. Freshly made guacamole with lime juice, coriander and ripe Hass avocados; slow-cooked, long-marinated outdoor reared pork topped with a red onion relish bright with citrus juices and habanero chillies; grilled, sustainably-caught fish with melting onion, fresh lime and pumpkin seed sauce; seasonal vegetables with zingy salsas - these are just some of our recipes lovingly prepared and served with soft, corn tortillas made down the road in North West London. We try to balance healthy eating with hearty eating. As in Mexico, our gluten-free corn tortillas are full of essential minerals, our black beans are full of complex carbohydrates and protein and our salsas are packed with all the vitamins that chillies and fresh fruit naturally bring you.

The success of this first project was soon followed by Bistro Jacques on Hardman Street, in the city's buzzing theatre-land. Bistro Franc, on Hanover Street was the next addition to the Bistro Qui? family, on the fringe of Liverpool's shopping mecca, \"L1\", a short distance from the famous Echo Arena. The Hub Alehouse & Kitchen located in The Casartelli Building (opposite Bistro Franc) opened last Spring. This was the duos first venture outside the Bistro concept and this award-winning gastro-pub has proven to be a resounding success, providing a relaxing place to meet, eat and drink. Bistro Qui? Limited opened Bistro Jacques Shrewsbury in the heart of Shropshire in the Summer of 2012.

It offers, among others: new email accounts, free web hosting, and domain name registration. The list of its 130 services includes the national and international headlines in the Polish language followed by business news, sports, motorization and new technologies, as well as online games, blogs, chat rooms, internet forums and a shopping arcade, not to mention the streaming radio and Internet television channels. Interia hosts one of Polish online encyclopedias, the Encyklopedia Internautica and the thematic catalogue of websites. It features also the weather info, astrology, virtual greeting cards popular locally, and hundreds of online chats (czaterie) with the \"KidProtect\" option. The portal was created by the ComArch Management IT corporation (listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange) and the RMF FM radio. The Interia S.A. company is almost wholly owned by RMF FM parent company, the German multimedia conglomerate Bauer Media Group, represented by Witold Woniak. Bauer bought 96,6% of its shares in September 2008 and controls 99% of its vote. Due to its availability and relaxed internal policy, the free hosting service Interia has become a popular spam redirector in recent time. Spammers frequently link to its free sub-domains in their spam campaigns to avoid having their messages easily detected as junk and automatically blocked. Although, there are many legitimate webpages as well as services listed at Interia (or perhaps because of it), spammers sign up for its free accounts in volumes similar to GeoCities (Yahoo!-owned service), although their perennial favorite seems to be Google's Blogspot based in the US. The redirect pages created by spammers at Interia link only to spamvertising.","companyPhone":"+48 126462700","companyRevenueIn000s":58998,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"retail.gifts","displayName":"Flowers, Gifts & Specialty Stores","isPrimary":false,"score":30},{"name":"retail","displayName":"Retail","isPrimary":false,"score":30}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isMasked":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Director, Information Technology & Chief Software Architect","jobTitle":"Director, Information Technology & Chief Software Architect","isPast":"False","personID":8714721126,"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Litewka","email":"andrzej.litewka@firma.interia.pl","location":{"Street":"9a Os.

When Amaya opened its doors in June 2007, the idea was simple: demonstrate that Indian food served in a modern way could still stay true to its roots. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic Indian cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each guestfeatures that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. When we opened, there wasn't an industry category to describe what we were doing. After 10 years and with several Amaya Express locations, we compete in a category of dining now called \"fine-casual,\" the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry, where customers expect food quality that's more in line with full-service restaurants, coupled with the speed and convenience of fast food. Our focus has always been on using the kinds of higher-quality ingredients and cooking techniques used in Indian high-end restaurants to make great food accessible at reasonable prices. But our vision has evolved. While using a variety of fresh ingredients remains the foundation of our menu, we believe that \"fresh is not enough, anymore.\" Now we want to know where all of our ingredients come from, so that we can be sure they are as flavourful as possible while understanding the environmental and societal impact of our business. We visited Amaya Fairview Mall Location last week, food was great, freshly cooked and very tasty. The staff welcomed us with a smile and service overall was excellent. The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of mouth-watering food. Overall a good meal and great value we will certainly be going back. First time trying this place and I LOVE IT! The food was delicious, the flavours were perfect and for a lunch special the price is right. I also love that they offer many gluten free and veggie options clearly marked. Wishing the owners all the best, I hope this place is here to stay!!
