Not so long ago, tequila girls, cheap shots and greasy tortilla chips were images that sprang to mind when 'Mexican' was done in Britain. At Wahaca we shook things up a bit and started doing things a little differently. Living in Mexico, running bars out there and having time to explore its amazing cuisine made me fall in love with the incredible vibrancy and freshness of real Mexican food. After a quick spin through the Masterchef kitchens I teamed up with Mark to create Wahaca's menu, constantly looking to the markets of Mexico for inspiration and recreating their wonderful food over here. We've worked hard to match the flavours of Mexico with ingredients that we can get hold of to create a constantly evolving, seasonal menu with ingredients sourced as locally as possibly, or grown and transported with care for the environment. Freshly made guacamole with lime juice, coriander and ripe Hass avocados; slow-cooked, long-marinated outdoor reared pork topped with a red onion relish bright with citrus juices and habanero chillies; grilled, sustainably-caught fish with melting onion, fresh lime and pumpkin seed sauce; seasonal vegetables with zingy salsas - these are just some of our recipes lovingly prepared and served with soft, corn tortillas made down the road in North West London. We try to balance healthy eating with hearty eating. As in Mexico, our gluten-free corn tortillas are full of essential minerals, our black beans are full of complex carbohydrates and protein and our salsas are packed with all the vitamins that chillies and fresh fruit naturally bring you. Where we have to buy from Mexico we constantly try to source direct from cooperatives which support local farming communities. We source our tequilas and mescals from small family-run businesses that make the best product we can buy.

When Amaya opened its doors in June 2007, the idea was simple: demonstrate that Indian food served in a modern way could still stay true to its roots. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic Indian cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each guestfeatures that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. When we opened, there wasn't an industry category to describe what we were doing. After 10 years and with several Amaya Express locations, we compete in a category of dining now called \"fine-casual,\" the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry, where customers expect food quality that's more in line with full-service restaurants, coupled with the speed and convenience of fast food. Our focus has always been on using the kinds of higher-quality ingredients and cooking techniques used in Indian high-end restaurants to make great food accessible at reasonable prices. But our vision has evolved. While using a variety of fresh ingredients remains the foundation of our menu, we believe that \"fresh is not enough, anymore.\" Now we want to know where all of our ingredients come from, so that we can be sure they are as flavourful as possible while understanding the environmental and societal impact of our business. We visited Amaya Fairview Mall Location last week, food was great, freshly cooked and very tasty. The staff welcomed us with a smile and service overall was excellent. The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of mouth-watering food. Overall a good meal and great value we will certainly be going back. First time trying this place and I LOVE IT! The food was delicious, the flavours were perfect and for a lunch special the price is right. I also love that they offer many gluten free and veggie options clearly marked. Wishing the owners all the best, I hope this place is here to stay!! Loved the food and very polite staffs at the front.

In 2009 we opened our first franchise stores with Costa Coffee & Iceland Foods. This was followed by the introduction of Hotel Chocolat & Cornish Bakery and in late 2011 we opened units with Crew Clothing & Jack Wills. In 2012 we were chosen as the first franchise location in the world for George, selling the full range of one of United Kingdom's leading volume retailers. We operate units for all of these brands in both islands of Jersey and Guernsey. In 2015, we added Moss Bros into our portfolio. Our latest addition in mid 2016, is Burger King in Jersey and we are actively looking to expand this brand into Guernsey. We now operate over 50 franchise locations and partner with 10 blue chip brands. Our success is down to our understanding of the local marketplace and the skills and experience of our team. The SandpiperCI Operating Board all have significant experience at Director level with UK retailers.

To the south lies the coastal villages and resorts of Scarborough , Filey and Bridlington . All these are well within a short drive. The nearest city inland is York. From the old town, 199 steps lead up to the parish church of St. Mary, whose churchyard on Whitbys East Cliff gave Bram Stoker the inspiration to write his world famous book, Dracula . The towns skyline is dominated by the ruins of St. Hildas Abbey, high on the East Cliff. Spreading below in the old town, a maze of alleyways and narrow streets run down to the busy quayside. The town has produced its own century explorer and voyager who had set sail in the Bark Endeavour from the harbour, the outstanding father and son whaling masters of the Scoresby family and pioneer photographer, Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. Whitby is a seaside town, port and civil parish in the Borough of Scarborough and English county of North Yorkshire. Whitby is situated on the east coast of Yorkshire facing the North Sea in a deep valley at the mouth of the River Esk. It has been a bridging point since at least medieval times and several bridges have spanned the river. The current bridge, built in 1908, is a swing bridge with a 75-foot span that separates the upper and lower harbours. The town is surrounded on its landward sides by the moorland of the North York Moors National Park and the North Sea abuts it on the seaward side. The coastal areas are designated part of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Heritage Coast. This stretch of coast, known as the Dinosaur Coast, the Fossil Coast or the Jurassic Coast, is around 35 miles long, stretching from Staithes in the north, to Flamborough Head in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

The company focused on providing value-added services to telecommunication service providers, in particular to mobile network operators. Comverse Technology had several wholly or partly owned subsidiaries. The name \"Comverse\" is a fusion of the words \"communication\" and \"versatility\". Founded in 1982, the company went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 1986. Led by co-founder and CEO Jacob \"Kobi\" Alexander, the company originally specialized in centralized hardware/software systems for voice and fax messaging and sold them to telecommunications companies and other large enterprises.

Starting in the late 1990s, Comverse's voice messaging software became its main product and the company grew rapidly with the surge in mobile phone use, passing the $1 billion mark in revenues. It established a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market and sold a popular short message service center (SMSC) product. While headquartered in the US, most of the company's research and development was done in Israel; Comverse became one of the more visible success stories in Israel's hi-tech industry. It was one of Israel's largest employers of software engineers, was closely followed in the nation's business press, and was the first Israeli-associated company to join the S&P 500 index. In 2006, Comverse was involved in an options backdating scandal. Alexander and two other top executives were charged in the US with multiple counts of conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and making false filings.

King Edward VII became the Hospital's first patron. With the encouragement of His Majesty King Edward VII, together with Agnes Keyser's enthusiasm, immense support was received from the individuals who later became known as Friends. Over 3,000 Friends pledge their support to the Hospital to this day. Sister Agnes and her staff continued to care for Officers in peacetime. She was renowned for her devoted service to the Hospital, her kindness, tact and firm, effective but inherently caring manner. The Hospital moved to its present site in Beaumont Street in 1948 when it was officially opened by Her Majesty Queen Mary. In 2000 the Hospital changed its title to King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes and more recently, in accordance with its charitable aim, the financial benefits to which Officer patients had been entitled, were unconditionally extended to all ranks of ex-Service personnel.

It was those expert dog and cat breeders who encouraged us to produce an even wider range of whole minced meats from Irish beef, Lincolnshire rabbit, Welsh lamb and lots of Great British meats supplied by local meat specialists. Today we have a team of experts who visit our meat suppliers, select the meat cuts for our foods only, make sure the products are ethically reared and where possible, we deal directly with the grower, farmer or meat provider. We transport these great quality ingredients back to our factory in Norfolk, sort, check and then pack them into the nutritious meals that are available from Natures Menu. We're the same family business now as we were back in 1981 and the business is now in the safe hands of the second generation of raw food experts. We select, buy, process, pack and transport all our own products, with our own vehicles and staff, directly to you.

It offers, among others: new email accounts, free web hosting, and domain name registration. The list of its 130 services includes the national and international headlines in the Polish language followed by business news, sports, motorization and new technologies, as well as online games, blogs, chat rooms, internet forums and a shopping arcade, not to mention the streaming radio and Internet television channels. Interia hosts one of Polish online encyclopedias, the Encyklopedia Internautica and the thematic catalogue of websites. It features also the weather info, astrology, virtual greeting cards popular locally, and hundreds of online chats (czaterie) with the \"KidProtect\" option. The portal was created by the ComArch Management IT corporation (listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange) and the RMF FM radio. The Interia S.A. company is almost wholly owned by RMF FM parent company, the German multimedia conglomerate Bauer Media Group, represented by Witold Woniak. Bauer bought 96,6% of its shares in September 2008 and controls 99% of its vote. Due to its availability and relaxed internal policy, the free hosting service Interia has become a popular spam redirector in recent time. Spammers frequently link to its free sub-domains in their spam campaigns to avoid having their messages easily detected as junk and automatically blocked. Although, there are many legitimate webpages as well as services listed at Interia (or perhaps because of it), spammers sign up for its free accounts in volumes similar to GeoCities (Yahoo!-owned service), although their perennial favorite seems to be Google's Blogspot based in the US. The redirect pages created by spammers at Interia link only to spamvertising.","companyPhone":"+48 126462700","companyRevenueIn000s":58998,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"retail.gifts","displayName":"Flowers, Gifts & Specialty Stores","isPrimary":false,"score":30},{"name":"retail","displayName":"Retail","isPrimary":false,"score":30}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2023-01-04","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]}],"companiesCount":0},

The project is working with governments, businesses and non-profit organisations around the world to quickly find solutions to deforestation, with the ambition of \"making the trees worth more alive than dead\". On 5 May 2009, The Princes Rainforests Project launched a global awareness campaign to improve understanding of the link between rainforests and climate change and the need for urgent action to stop deforestation in the run up to the climate change conference in Copenhagen in December 2009. A number of celebrities worked with the PRP to promote the campaign. The Prince's Rainforest Project is now a part of the International Sustainability Unit, which was also created by the Prince in relation to international deforestation.","companyPhone":"+44 1214494198","companyRevenueIn000s":11300,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.lodging","displayName":"Lodging & Resorts","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":false,"score":45},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":false,"score":45}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2019-12-11","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":346060783,"companyIds":[346060783,355669473,437728769],"companyName":"Ku De Ta","location":{"Street":"306 Riverside Dr","City":"East Perth","State":"Western Australia","Zip":"6004","CountryCode":"Australia"},"revenue":"$21.5 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":100,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.kudeta.com","website":"www.kudeta.com","companyDescription":"KU DE TA conceives and develops luxury entertainment spaces, including club lounges, restaurants and bars, to reflect the uniqueness of our surroundings and the innate desire of people to connect - and disconnect.

Read on .. Tim Heasman (Director of Salsa Nights/Salsa exchange, Salsa instructor and DJ) Having been a drummer from a young age Tim was attracted to the lively and energetic rhythms of latin music. He went to his first salsa class thirteen years ago and soon became hooked. He taught his first lesson aged 18, since then he has taught salsa and bachata in bars and clubs across the South-West and now teaches regular weekly classes in Bristol and Bath. He has also organised and hosted many successful weekend events in Woolacombe, working closely with teachers such as Nigel May, Lee Hunter, Irene Davies and Femi to deliver the ultimate weekender experience to his guests. As well as being a respected salsa teacher, he is also a top salsa DJ. He is renowned for playing danceable R&B tracks and getting everyone moving with his energetic line-ups. Inspired by the music and rhythms of Riverdance Natasha began dancing aged 8, regularly competing in regional Irish dancing competitions across Wales and in Ireland. This was a passion that lasted until she was aged 17 and moved away to Bath to study Natural Sciences at University. It was here in 2008, that she discovered salsa, a relaxed, fun and social dance the complete opposite to the conform and constraints of Irish dancing with its set dances and strict rules. Swapping her tap shoes for latin heels, she soon became hooked and after a year of lessons at the Universitys salsa society with teacher Phil Heath, she was brave enough to go to her first night of freestyle in the city centre with Bath Salsa at Club XL, it was here that she met Tim and theyve been dancing and teaching together across the South-West ever since. Tashas style of salsa, much like Tims, is a fusion of LA cross- body style and cuban salsa. She enjoys teaching and dancing la rueda and is confident in teaching ladies styling techniques.","companyPhone":"+44 1768868666","companyRevenueIn000s":15615,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.fitness","displayName":"Fitness & Dance Facilities","isPrimary":false,"score":30},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":false,"score":30}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2020-10-26","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]}],"companiesCount":0},

He pioneered the do-it-yourself concept with his first store at 4110 N. Market Street in Spokane, using his experience in residential construction to advise customers on how to do their projects. Vern's goal at that time was the same as it is today - to offer the customer the highest quality merchandise at contractor prices, along with excellent service and good advice for the homeowner to do his or her own projects. Having been called \"Ziggy\" much of his life, Vern's company soon became well known as \"Ziggy's.\" Today, Ziggy's is the home improvement price and service leader in the Inland Northwest, with six retail locations.

Main objective of MIMAG Energy Inc. is to provide all kind of services to the industrialists and investors from project development through commissioning. Since its foundation, MIMAG Energy has conveyed his extensive technological knowledge to many industrialists and investors, while improving his engineering knowledge in building electricity, steam and cogeneration plants in cooperation with many foreign companies. Equipment supply was the core business of the Company at the beginning. Later on, by taking the advantage of wide experience of his parent company MIMAG Construction and Trade Inc. in engineering and construction works of industrial facilities and power plants, MIMAG Energy reached his goal of constructing electricity and/or steam generating plants on turnkey basis. We have experience of cooperating with many manufacturers from different countries, but majority of those companies are from China. Especially, as a result of our productive and comprehensive cooperation with CMEC (China Machinery Engineering Corporation), one of the leading Chinese companies, we brought lots of power plants with fluidized bed technology to our country.

Located on a hilltop below Ulus Park in the upscale neighborhood of Ulus, we offer a spectacular view of the Bosphorus, Bosphorus Bridge and Asian shoreline. Initially specializing in \"California\" cuisine and also preparing the best grilled steaks in Istanbul, different authentic tastes from Turkish cuisine were also added to the menu to respond to the needs of our international clientele. Noticing the rise in the popularity of Japanese cuisine in the city, in 1999 Sunset was the first restaurant in Istanbul to add a Sushi Bar for the discerning clientele. Diners in Istanbul were introduced to \"New Japanese Cuisine\" when Hiroki Takemura, the Master Chef of the internationally acclaimed Nobu Restaurant in London joined Sunset Grill&Bar offering his interpretations of Japanese cuisine. His specialties include a choice of starters and main courses and change according to season. Today, our menu includes a vast selection of specialties from International, Turkish and New Japanese cuisines along with a Sushi Bar. At Sunset Grill&Bar, we have a longstanding highly professional and skilled kitchen and wait staff, consistently offering our customers quality service and excellent food. Besides being a member of the Chaîne des Rôtisseurs since 1999, Sunset Grill&Bar is the recipient of several international and domestic awards. In 2002 and 2009, we were selected among the \"Best Restaurants in Istanbul\" by the Zagat Survey prepared for European cities. We were selected the best restaurant in Istanbul in 2004 by Time Out Istanbul. In 1999, Sunset Grill&Bar was invited to prepare specialties from Turkish Cuisine at the James Beard Foundation's \"Oscars\" recognized as one of the major foundations in the gastronomy world. Sunset Grill&Bar has spacious indoor and outdoor dining areas with a timeless decor with a separate indoor and outdoor bar where you can enjoy cocktails pre and post lunch or dinner.","companyPhone":"+90 2122870357","companyRevenueIn000s":20180,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":59},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":59}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]}],"companiesCount":0},

We have spent many years dedicated to the food and service industries. From our humble beginnings in 1991, in a florist shop, we transformed an old, rundown church building into a busy wedding chapel business. We needed the ability to prepare foods, for the wedding business, so we went to work once again, and took an old house we used for storage, and made it into a commercial kitchen, with individual dining rooms. Little did we know, we were about to jump into the restaurant business with vigor and enthusiasm. In 1999, we opened the full service restaurant and catering business, in the small, rural west Tennessee town of Troy. But with all of this, we felt the need for a place of our own to have larger banquets and receptions. In 2003, we designed and built The Moffat Centre in Troy. We discovered that we have a passion for providing great quality services and diverse products to this small rural community - services which typically are only found in larger cities. It was our desire to take this passion, and put it into a newer designed building, serving an upscale quality menu, in a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere and include a patio area, and bar. The opportunity presented itself, and once again we began planning the next phase of our business. In January of 2007, we assumed management and operations of The Quality Inn Banquet facility, housed within The Quality Inn Hotel, in Union City, Tennessee. In early 2007, we began construction on the Sassafraz Restaurant building in Union City, and opened for business October 23rd, 2007. We stay very involved in our business day to day, and have found the need to concentrate our efforts in our restaurant and catering business. We still use the experience and knowledge we gained in the floral and wedding business in the many events we have at our banquet centers and outside catering venues.","companyPhone":"(416) 964-2222","companyRevenueIn000s":15927,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":50}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-06-09","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":348018846,"companyIds":[397836034,348018846,434787006],"companyName":"The British Club","location":{"Street":"189 Suriwongse Road Bangrak","City":"Bangkok","State":"Bangkok","Zip":"10500","CountryCode":"Thailand"},"revenue":"$24.5 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":715,"employeesRange":"500 - 1,000","companyDomain":"www.britishclubbangkok.org","website":"www.britishclubbangkok.org","companyDescription":"The British Club Bangkok was founded on 23rd April, being Saint George's Day, 1903 by a small group of British businessmen and diplomatic civil servants, in order to create a social club in the style enjoyed by their peers in the British Empire throughout Asia. Siam, as Thailand was then known, was a very different place to now and Bangkok was far, far smaller, consisting only of Rattanakosin Island (where the Grand Palace is located) and a sway of development lining both sides of the Chao Phraya river such that places well known today like the Victory Monument, Khlong Toey and Don Muang were just distant rice fields, accessed only by narrow khlongs (canals). Khrung Thep (the abbreviation of the Thai name for Bangkok) had no bridges over the river; only two railway lines - one to Nakhon Ratchasima, and another to Paknam now called Samut Prakan both single track from a station close to present day Hua Lampong; two tram lines which ran from the Grand Palace to Thanon Tok near Bangkok Port and to Hua Lampong; very few actual roads; and no local banks! It did, however, boast two English language newspapers, the Bangkok Times and the Bangkok Daily Mail. The British Empire consulate was on the Chao Phraya river adjacent to the present Portuguese Embassy, and the Siamese currency of the day was the Tical and exchanged at the rate of 13 to £1 Sterling. The founding fathers, as it was solely a male preserve, were drawn from the British Diplomatic Mission and various companies like The Borneo Company, Louis T. Leonowens, The Anglo-Thai Company and Tilleke & Gibbins, the last of which would play a significant role in the later years of Club history as well. IThe Club was initially set up as a debenture membership and was restricted only to the directors and senior managers of those companies, with other minions only allowed in as guests. By July of 1903, sufficient funds had been raised to open a 'clubhouse'.

The Association will also seek to assist the Sa¯d Business School establish itself as, and then retain the position of, one of the world's finest centres for studying management and organisation. In April 1998, Sir Michael Perry, first Chairperson of the OBA, formally launched the association. John Kay delivered the OBA Inaugural Lecture at the Institute of Chartered Accountants on 29th September 1998. OBA was incorporated as a private limited company on 25th May 1999. To maximise networking potential, during the initial launch period all graduates of Oxford with an interest in business were offered the option of being grandfathered into OBA. The Friends of Templeton, were also invited to transfer their membership to OBA. Since then OBA has furthered its objectives through producing an alumni directory, establishing a website of information (giving access to membership news and an interrogative membership database) and through organising networking events and lectures for members. Members are also sent regular mailings of SBS news and are encouraged to support the School through marketing of student programmes and other School PR initiatives, helping students job search and identifying student projects. The University of Oxford (SBS) has now become the major fund provider for OBA. To guarantee long-term financial security for the organisation the assets and membership of the Company were transferred to the University on 15th July 2002. The company is now dormant and the OBA Board of Directors has been re-named The OBA Advisory Board.","companyPhone":"+44 1865288878","companyRevenueIn000s":19720,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.lodging","displayName":"Lodging & Resorts","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":false,"score":45},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":false,"score":45}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":1154637349,"companyIds":[1154637349,1226890622,1230812709,1305358122,1274972655,1229621596],"companyName":"Flunch","location":{"Street":"Immeuble Péricentre Bvd Van Gogh","City":"Villeneuve-D'Ascq","State":"Wallis and Futuna","Zip":"59650","CountryCode":"France"},"revenue":"$75.9 Million","revenueRange":"$50 mil. - $100 mil.","employees":364,"employeesRange":"250 - 500","companyDomain":"www.flunch.fr","website":"www.flunch.fr","companyDescription":"Flunch is a French cafeteria-style fast casual restaurant chain that is owned by the Agapes Restauration group","companyPhone":"+33 320054660","companyRevenueIn000s":75920,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":45},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":45}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-06-27","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":431320126,"companyIds":[1269236212,431320126],"companyName":"Matterhorn Group","location":{"Street":"2900m Trockener Steg","City":"Zermatt","State":"Valais","Zip":"3920","CountryCode":"Switzerland"},"revenue":"$42.8 Million","revenueRange":"$25 mil. - $50 mil.","employees":231,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.matterhorn-group.ch","website":"www.matterhorn-group.ch","companyDescription":"Matterhorn Group AG is a company that operates in the Restaurants industry.

In over 200 years, spanning the reigns of nine monarchs, it has been owned by only three families . . . just before The Great War, Charles Rule, a descendant of the founder, was thinking of moving to Paris; by sheer coincidence he met Tom Bell, a Briton who owned a Parisian restaurant called the Alhambra, and the two men decided to swap businesses. (During the war Tom Bell was an officer in the Royal Flying Corps, and left the running of the restaurant to Charlie, the Head Waiter, who had served Charles Rule for many years.) During the second world war, Rules stayed open but its structure was reinforced with thick wood. It was only open from 1pm to 3pm and offered the compulsory rationed meals at five shillings but could offer copious rabbits, grouse and pheasants which were not rationed. A lady was the Head Waiter during the war. The restaurant could never open on Sundays because it was on Church grounds and could not get a licence. In 1984 Tom Bell's daughter sold Rules to John Mayhew, the present owner. Today Rules seats around 90 people and employs 90 staff. Rules serves the traditional food of this country at its best - and at affordable prices. It specialises in classic game cookery, oysters, pies and puddings.","companyPhone":"+44 2078365314","companyRevenueIn000s":14151,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":157},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":157}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-05-25","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":346280611,"companyIds":[446060082,354814820,346280611,372895907],"companyName":"Rosa's Thai Cafe","location":{"Street":"6 Theberton St","City":"London","State":"Essex","Zip":"N1 0QX","CountryCode":"United Kingdom"},"revenue":"$22.1 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":117,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.rosasthaicafe.com","website":"www.rosasthaicafe.com","companyDescription":"Combining modern London with Bangkok, Rosas Thai Cafe serves authentic Thai food & cuisine, with dining, delivery, & takeaway services available at our locations.","companyPhone":"+44 2033932482","companyRevenueIn000s":22138,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"totalFundingAmountIn000s":3416,"isDefunct":false,"funding":[{"amountIn000s":2568,"date":"2016-01-25","round":"Private Equity","investors":[{"investorName":"Santander Corporate & Commercial","investorDomain":"santander.co.uk","investorCompanyId":"348465092"}]},{"amountIn000s":848,"date":"2014-07-27","round":"Private Equity","investors":[{}]}],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":357333703,"companyIds":[357333703,1143505123],"companyName":"GameTime","location":{"Street":"5701 Sunset Dr Ste 330","City":"Miami","State":"Florida","Zip":"33143","CountryCode":"United States"},"revenue":"$13 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":53,"employeesRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.gametimeplayers.com","website":"www.gametimeplayers.com","companyDescription":"Thank you for making Bryan's 11th birthday something he will never forget!

At that time, I used my name as a domain for the blog using the free BlogSpot platform. My first post was about a restaurant I went to many times during my uni years, Pancakes on the Rocks , Sydney. It was a very short blog post highlighting one of the best dishes I had ever tasted at that time, The Ultimate. I still preserved this blog under a sub-domain blog.ardipradana.com. As I learned gradually into food blogging, I gained insights about the importance of words choices and felt that pictures were as important as the description of the experience. I moved away to D-SLR from smart phone photography (although sometimes I still do it when I didnt bring my camera). I began to upgrade my photography and Photoshop skills to brush up the pictures. Recently I came back to the basic of photography and stripped off all formatting for my pictures. I felt that by giving frames and other gimmicks, my pictures looked more artificial. Now, I trust my camera and lens abilities to produce these pictures. I use Nikon D7000 with my faithful Sigma 50 mm f/1.4. In 2012, All About Food blog relocated to the current address to enhance our readers experience in reading the blog. I also redesigned it for a fresher and updated look and I thank my friends at AWDesain.com for all of these to happen as painless as possible. In 2013, I retired my faithful Sigma 50mm f/1.4. It is still a very good lens, but for large plates, I usually cant take the picture unless I stand up or take it from a distance. In a restaurant setting, it is hard to do without giving away what you are trying to do. Thus, I now use Nikon 35mm f/1.8. Please contact us if you have any suggestions or comments on anything. Thank you for visiting my blog Once again, Welcome to All About Food blog and I hope I can help you in deciding where to eat next","companyPhone":"+61 296992455","companyRevenueIn000s":31052,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"media","displayName":"Media & Internet","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"media.publishing","displayName":"Publishing","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":false,"score":30},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":false,"score":30}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Media & Internet"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":372519541,"companyIds":[372519541,1167868787,430795885,1156824355,433050632],"companyName":"Kaufland Ostrava-Zbeh","location":{"Street":"3086/44 Výškovická","City":"Ostrava","Zip":"700 30","CountryCode":"Czech Republic"},"revenue":"$113.3 Million","revenueRange":"$100 mil. - $250 mil.","employees":1372,"employeesRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.kaufland.cz","website":"www.kaufland.cz","companyDescription":"Kaufland Ostrava-Zbeh is a company that operates in the Retail industry.

Our kebabs are made from quality ingredients that are exclusive to Doner Kebab Restaurants. The great taste comes from the SECRET SAUCES that set our products apart, from our competitors.

We only use fresh, locally produced vegetables that are delivered and prepared daily along with our special \"Doner Kebab\" bread. These make the \"Doner Kebab\" a truly unique taste experience of our customers. Our tried and tested methods are totally different to the way other operators make their kebabs. The result is a nutritionally sound gourmet food experience that contains virtually no preservatives or additives and can be consumed day or night. With a strong modern brand and the promotion of healthy, fresh, nutritious ingredients that appeals to a broad market, \"Doner Kebab\" can only continue to grow and succeed.

However, over the years, the restaurant was made available for all kinds of entertainment ie: Bingo nights, games nights, darts, dominoes etc. There has been a lot of fantastic music bands from all over the Costas having played there.

Together, the pair have created some of Londons most iconic restaurants. Along with their most recent opening, Soutine, in St Johns Wood, they continue to make a significant contribution to the hospitality industry. Chris Corbin and Jeremy King first met whilst working at Langan's Brasserie and Joe Allen's respectively, both influential restaurants on the London scene in the late 1970s. In 1981, they acquired Le Caprice and despite initial challenges, it soon become a huge success. In 1990, they opened The Ivy - a restaurant that over the following years consistently topped the guides as the most popular restaurant in London. The theme of restoring faded restaurants to their former glory continued with the purchase and renovation of J. Sheekey in 1998. In the same year, Caprice Holdings Limited was sold to Signature Restaurants, and Corbin & King remained as non-executive Directors until 2002. Corbin & King then acquired the site of 160 Piccadilly and their lifelong ambition to open an all-day brasserie-restaurant in the grand European style was realised with the opening of The Wolseley in November 2003. Corbin & King (formerly Rex Restaurant Associates until January 2014) was created to manage the future expansion of the company's interests and to focus on new opportunities in London and abroad, as well as manage the existing portfolio, including The Delaunay in Aldwych (December 2011), Brasserie Zédel on Sherwood Street (June 2012), Colbert on Sloane Square (October 2012), Fischer's on Marylebone High Street (Spring 2014), Café Wolseley at Bicester Village (June 2018) and Soutine in St John's Wood (April 2019).","companyPhone":"+44 2076471810","companyRevenueIn000s":118558,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-08-02","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":425312637,"companyIds":[425312637],"companyName":"Centrale Europeenne De Distribution SAS","location":{"Street":"37-39 Rue De Neuilly","City":"Clichy","State":"Hauts-de-seine","Zip":"92110","CountryCode":"France"},"revenue":"$31.4 Million","revenueRange":"$25 mil. - $50 mil.","employees":165,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.c10.fr","website":"www.c10.fr","companyDescription":"Centrale Europeenne De Distribution SAS is a company that operates in the Restaurants industry.

That's one of the reasons why VisitBritain's largest campaign for 2016 - the GREAT Britain 'Home of Amazing Moments' campaign (#OMGB) has a strong digital focus to promote memorable moments visitors can only experience on a trip to Britain. It aims to show people the experiences, culture and countryside available across Britain to inspire them to want to be part of it and book a trip to come and discover their own amazing moments. It invites people to share their amazing UK moments using the hashtag #OMGB, which will also be used by the travel bloggers attending the summit. Encouraging visitors to share their own holiday experiences online is already a key way that VisitBritain is inspiring more people to come to Britain. The national tourism agency is a frontrunner in the digital space, ranking first among key competitors in number of Twitter followers (300k) and third for Facebook fans (3 million) and Weibo followers (510,000).

The warm, wood-panelled Restaurant is an ideal venue for both an important business lunch (customers cross the City of London for its famed Cheeseboard) and for a romantic 'diner a deux' - it was voted by 'The Times' as the most romantic restaurant in London. Bleeding Heart Restaurant the flagship of the group, which offers modern French food, 'impeccable service', an award-winning 'encyclopaedic' wine list and above all a uniquely welcoming ambience. Our busy buzzy French Bistro with its striking 19th Century French wine posters and eccentric Vineyard Sculpture combines a warm ambience and cheerful yet professional service with traditional French dishes plus a great-value list of 450 wines by the bottle and more than a dozen by the glass. It has been noted by City AM as \"the best French Bistro in London\". The Bistro has a 60 seat Terrace, highly popular throughout the summer for its Lobster dishes and its chilled Rose. The Tavern is our Gastropub, open from 7am to 11 pm. Its history stretches back to 1746, when its slogan was 'drunk for a penny and dead drunk for two pence'. That spirit of good cheer continues today with real ales from Adnams, an extensive range of wines by the glass and a great-value menu ranging from a very generous Full English Breakfast with warm baguettes and croissants from our own bakery, to Spit- Roasted Suckling Pigs , Free-range Chickens and a noted Suffolk Lamburger.","companyPhone":"+44 2072428238","companyRevenueIn000s":13762,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":50}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2019-12-08","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":426569321,"companyIds":[426569321],"companyName":"Boztekin Otomotiv Sanayi ve Ticaret AŞ","location":{"City":"Bursa","CountryCode":"Turkey"},"revenue":"$20 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":108,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.boztekin.com.tr","website":"www.boztekin.com.tr","companyDescription":"Boztekin Otomotiv Sanayi ve Ticaret AŞ is a company that operates in the Restaurants industry.

Later that same year, they converted a Fort Myers Beach location into a Rib City®, and the legend continued. In 1994, a location in North Naples was opened and Rib Citys® award-winning Baby Back Ribs were now available in two counties.

To start, you can dine on our Vegetable spring rolls served with sweet chili sauce and Kaffir sweetcorn fritters with paprika and crisp basil leaves. Explore the authentic taste of our mushroom and tofu satay with peanut sauce and a generous portion of Mushroom tom yum soup, with that additional Asian spice. Our 'Christmas Cracker,' as we like to call it, consists of three shared starters and soup, four main courses served with our steamed Hom Mali rice, and a homemade sorbet to finish. Authentic Thai cuisine is known for its passionate use of fresh herbs, At Patara, we execute this flawlessly with our Spicy herb tossed tofu, made with holy basil, widely used in Asia for culinary, medicinal and religious purposes, producing a delightful fragrance and added spice. Our Vegetable kieaw wan green curry, a Central Thai variety of Curry, made with fresh green chilies, is loved for its aromatic and fragrant flavor. The flavorsome dish is achieved through a perfect blend of curry paste and coconut milk, a combination of spiciness and richness, when prepared accurately. The green curry is another Vegetarian Christmas special of ours and this signature dish plays a large role in authentic Thai cuisine. Tofu with panang sauce is perfect for our Vegetarian diners who like that additional spice, which alongside our wok tossed seasonal vegetables creates an authentic culinary experience. At Patara, we look after our vegetarian diners, and go that extra mile for them over the Christmas period with our carefully selected Thai dishes.","companyPhone":"+65 67370818","companyRevenueIn000s":16477,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":50}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-04-13","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":460520518,"companyIds":[460520518],"companyName":"Hard Rock Cafe Helsinki","location":{"CountryCode":"Finland"},"revenue":"$28.2 Million","revenueRange":"$25 mil. - $50 mil.","employees":156,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.hardrockcafe.fi","website":"www.hardrockcafe.fi","companyDescription":"Hard Rock Cafe Inc. is a chain of theme restaurants founded in 1971 by Isaac Tigrett and Peter Morton in London.","companyRevenueIn000s":28173,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":3},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":3}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2021-08-03","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":397749436,"companyIds":[397749436],"companyName":"Bcmma","location":{"Street":"Cowdray Ave","City":"Colchester","State":"Essex","Zip":"CO1 1YH","CountryCode":"United Kingdom"},"revenue":"$19.1 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":97,"employeesRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.bcmma.co.uk","website":"www.bcmma.co.uk","companyDescription":"He stated \"BCMMA is already one of the top UK shows, I strongly believe Jack & I are the 2 people who can take this show forward and turn the show into the biggest platform in the UK for fighters to reach the top promotions.

Being a Mexican food fanatic, John quickly introduced Karen to the burrito. When the summer ended, Karen had to return to Ireland. Once home, she realised she missed John, but more importantly burritos and made the decision to move back to Philadelphia. Karen became addicted to burritos as much as John, so it only made sense that they marry. It's still debatable whether Karen moved to America for John or for the love of a good burrito. Upon returning to Ireland, they were unable to find decent Mexican food or a burrito bar anywhere, so they decided they would open their own.

It was back then that Mr Titcombe, baking in Burford, delivered bread and cakes to the villagers with his donkey and cart. Given the impracticalities of donkeys we've progressed a bit since then, but we still bake everything by hand using the finest ingredients. Our bakers work through the night, producing everything from the bread we use to make our sandwiches to the most intricate tiered wedding cakes. We don't believe our customers should settle for anything less than the best tasting British bakery produce and freshly prepared dishes. In the kitchens our chefs use fresh and seasonal ingredients sourced locally to prepare our dishes. That's why, for instance, you'll find Gloucester Old Spot sausage in our flour dusted baps and if you ask for ketchup or salad dressing you'll be served our own homemade recipe. Our specials boards allow us to offer the best local produce as soon as it becomes available. Our teas, which we buy directly from the finest small producers around the world under our ethical trading initiative, are blended with fine local ingredients including Cotswold fruits and lavender from Snowshill near Broadway. Huffkins is an accredited supplier to the National Trust and a supplier of breads, cakes and patisserie to many local hotels, businesses and organisations.","companyPhone":"+44 1993822126","companyRevenueIn000s":24963,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"retail.grocery","displayName":"Grocery Retail","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"retail","displayName":"Retail","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":false,"score":45},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":false,"score":45}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2021-07-26","topLevelIndustry":["Retail"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":425464672,"companyIds":[425464672,563244846],"companyName":"S-Kreditpartner","location":{"Street":"25 Prinzregentenstraße","City":"Berlin","State":"Berlin","Zip":"10715","CountryCode":"Germany"},"revenue":"$134.1 Million","revenueRange":"$100 mil. - $250 mil.","employees":550,"employeesRange":"500 - 1,000","companyDomain":"www.s-kreditpartner.de","website":"www.s-kreditpartner.de","companyDescription":"S-Kreditpartner provides personal and automotive financing services in Germany.","companyPhone":"+49 30620080401","companyRevenueIn000s":134140,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-01-11","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":372775207,"companyIds":[372775207],"companyName":"Zti Group","location":{"Street":"5 Novotného Lávka","City":"Prague","Zip":"11000","CountryCode":"Czech Republic"},"revenue":"$36.7 Million","revenueRange":"$25 mil. - $50 mil.","employees":116,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.zatisigroup.cz","website":"www.zatisigroup.cz","companyDescription":"Zti Group's 4 exceptional restaurants in Prague, Zti catering in Prague, Czech Republic, Europe, Zti Fresh & Tasty, Zti with Unicef and People in Need","companyPhone":"+420 277000109","companyRevenueIn000s":36734,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-12-22","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":28264830,"companyIds":[436536112,28264830,30332110],"companyName":"Fisherman's Crab Deck","location":{"Street":"3032 Kent Narrow Way S","City":"Grasonville","State":"Maryland","Zip":"21638","CountryCode":"United States"},"revenue":"$17.8 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":91,"employeesRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.crabdeck.com","website":"www.crabdeck.com","companyDescription":"Maryland Eastern Shore Seafood Restaurants.

As weve grown, so has our menu and our community, yet our values have stayed the same. We take the time to make our bread, pastries, cakes, breakfasts and lunches as we always have with care, by hand and according to the season so that we dont need to compromise on what we eat, whether were on the go, or taking time out in one of our bakeries. Everyone is welcome in our bakeries. We believe in the power of community, in helping those around us and living as sustainably as possible. We insist on the finest ingredients, supporting small businesses wherever we can, and though were always innovating, our baking is based on time-honoured techniques and our decades-old starters. Nothing gives us as much pleasure as a freshly baked, lovingly crafted loaf. We bake by hand with natural ingredients, and whilst we are ordinary people, we want to make extraordinary things. We want to play our part to bring humanity back into the food world, back to local communities. We cant imagine doing anything more gratifying than baking our, and your, bread. In the 1990s, Gail Mejia brought the best bakers in town together to bake for Londons top chefs and restaurants. Our wholesale business, The Bread Factory, which was named ironically because it has always exclusively specialised in handmade, traditional artisan baking, continues to thrive, serving top restaurants and discerning customers. Our first GAILs bakery opened in Londons Hampstead High Street in 2005. Today, we have 69 bakeries in neighbourhoods in and around London, Oxford, Brighton and beyond. We bake fresh, handmade bread, pastries and cakes every day, served with our carefully-sourced house blend specialty coffee. We take great pleasure in using the best ingredients we can find for food and drink, using seasonal ingredients from suppliers we trust. Though weve grown over the years, our philosophy has remained the same: to make good food that people love, and create bakeries that people want to keep coming back to.

Grupo Tragaluz has grown by using intuition and a commitment to doing things well. All its restaurants have been created from a common idea: to be different. Behind each one is a unique concept guided by the diverse inspirations or cultural influences that surround it. The importance of good food and attention to detail and style, whether in the restaurant design, the preparation of dishes or the menu itself, define each individual identity of the Tragaluz restaurants. They are carefully created places where clients eat well and have a positive dining experience. And all at an honest price. In 1987, Rosa Maria Esteva and Tomás Tarruella, mother and son, founded Mordisco, a simple restaurant that sought to offer sandwiches, homemade food and salads in a central location on Passeig de Gracia in Barcelona. The idea was to create a place that was like being at home, with informal cuisine and shared tables. It was a very innovative concept at the time, and quickly turned Mordisco into a renowned restaurant. This success motivated them to expand the business with other restaurants, each conceived independently and planned with the utmost care. Mordisco was followed by Tragaluz (1991), Tragamar (1996), Agua (1997), Acontraluz (1997), Negro, El Japonés (1999) and Bestial (2002). A new venture began in 2003, with the first hotel, the Omm. With its urban and cosmopolitan character and a wide range of gastronomic and leisure activities, it quickly became a popular meeting place for both visitors and locals. After the Omm, more restaurants were launched: Rojo (2005), Cuines Santa Caterina (2005), Bar Lobo (2006), and La Xina (2008). The first restaurant opened in Madrid, Tomato Bar (2009), followed by Luzi Bombón (2011). This same year Luzia and Pez Vela were inaugurated in Barcelona.

The bakery at 104 W. Caroline St. stretches for nearly a block and is easily identified by its bright yellow awnings. Large glass windows look in on the busy kitchens and showcase the classically trained bakers at work alongside an impressive bread oven from Verona, Italy. While most of the building is dedicated to production, a small retail space is modeled after bakeries the owners visited in Montreal, Toronto and New York. The warehouse-styled space features a chandelier of interlocking glass Cs created by a local artist along with re-purposed seating and display pieces collected from area antique and consignment shops. Most commercial baking facilities would shy away from a production facility with so few walls, since this is where most bakeries place equipment - ovens, proofers, refrigeration units and the like. It would have been much easier and less costly to build a new facility to our specifications. But we wanted to re-purpose and revitalize a building in this community's downtown, just as we wanted to revitalize and preserve the traditional artisan methods of baking from scratch. CRUST is owned by the same families who own and operate The Laundry, a popular dining destination in downtown Fenton since 1997. Their bakery concept had been simmering since early 2009 and when offered the opportunity to revitalize another downtown property, the group embraced it and spent the next 13 months reworking the space on W. Caroline. CRUST opened in February 1, 2012. ARE YOU HUNGRY FOR MORE? CRUST is dedicated to excellence in artisan principles, with all-natural ingredients that are locally sourced and organic whenever possible. The flours we use in our products are all unbleached and unbromated, and we partner with suppliers who source their wheat from non-GMO sources. CRUST produces over 120 different baked goods, and all are handcrafted using traditional baking methods.

Based in the heart of the South Downs, we officially launched the new Upham Brewery in May 2013. We now supply over 250 stockists, including leading pubs, hotels and local Majestic and Co-op stores with our staple ales; Punter, Tipster and Stakes. We also produce a number of seasonal special ales. The company also owns a growing family of pubs and inns across Hampshire, Berkshire, Sussex and Wiltshire with plans to increase the portfolio. We choose pubs with character and charm in country locations that have suffered from a lack of investment and care. We then improve, reinvigorate and upgrade them to bring them to life in a way that locals and visitors alike really appreciate. This helps us to fulfil their true potential through offering superb food, drink and, in most cases, accommodation as well as creating a relaxing and welcoming atmosphere. Crucially, each has its own particular personality, charm and character, which is what attracted us to them in the first place.

Limited is a family of restaurants based in Liverpool city centre, with head office located on the historic Rodney Street. The company was first established in 2003, operated by family members, Mark Friend and Stephen Slater. An appetite for fresh food, quality wines, beers and the desire to exceed customer expectations were the driving forces behind them setting up their first restaurant, Bistro Pierre, in Liverpools vibrant Cavern Quarter. The success of this first project was soon followed by Bistro Jacques on Hardman Street, in the city's buzzing theatre-land. Bistro Franc, on Hanover Street was the next addition to the Bistro Qui? family, on the fringe of Liverpool's shopping mecca, \"L1\", a short distance from the famous Echo Arena. The Hub Alehouse & Kitchen located in The Casartelli Building (opposite Bistro Franc) opened last Spring. This was the duos first venture outside the Bistro concept and this award-winning gastro-pub has proven to be a resounding success, providing a relaxing place to meet, eat and drink. Bistro Qui? Limited opened Bistro Jacques Shrewsbury in the heart of Shropshire in the Summer of 2012. The daily changing menus, combined with a warm, inviting and relaxed style of service has placed the Shrewsbury venture as a popular dining out destination for the community.","companyPhone":"+44 1517036777","companyRevenueIn000s":55792,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2019-08-21","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":430492897,"companyIds":[430492897],"companyName":"VSHosting","location":{"Street":"1579/5 Sodomkova","City":"Prague","Zip":"102 00","CountryCode":"Czech Republic"},"revenue":"$12.8 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":72,"employeesRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.vshosting.cz","website":"www.vshosting.cz","companyDescription":"VSHosting is a company that operates in the Restaurants industry.

Since then we have added several new units and are continuing to grow and expand annually. Our organization was founded on the belief that you should work hard and have a lot of fun doing it. We believe that a company is only as good as the people who work for it. That is the reason we strive to put our people first by creating a family environment where the door is always open. We demonstrate that we value them in many ways. Some examples of this are a healthy compensation and benefits program. We also celebrate our teams throughout the year with group activities, team meetings and awards. Our company believes in the efforts of our people and that is the reason we have created robust recognition programs that include all of our team members. Customer focus is another essential element to running great restaurants and we pride ourselves on having a \"whatever it takes\" attitude when it comes to taking care of our guests. This has resulted in our organization consistently ranking at the top tier of franchisees nationally in guest measures. We also firmly believe that results must be achieved with integrity.

SINCE ROSEPEPPER'S OPENING IN 2001, founder Ernest Chaires was a pioneer of what is now the East Nashville bar and restaurant scene. Winning numerous awards including Nashville's Best Mexican Restaurant and Best Margarita, for the 11th year in a row, Rosepepper has established itself as Nashville's leading tequila bar and restaurant. Specializing in Sonoran Style Mexican cuisine, we offer an eclectic menu only to be matched by our equally unique vibe and atmosphere. With a full bar and over eighty varieties of tequila, it is the ideal jumpstart for a night on the town or a festive dinner among friends. Rosepepper Cantina mirrors the food of the Mexican state of Sonora - a fusion of traditional Mexican, French and native influences - making it the unique Mexican dining experience in Nashville. The food is as diverse and creative as the environment, with options ranging from Chile Verde to Cabo Tacos and Carne Asada. Unlike Tex-Mex, this style of cooking includes traditional Mexican ingredients such as beans, corn, potatoes and pepper, yet typically favors slow-simmered shredded meats to ground varieties, and incorporates chopped vegetables into its flash-fried rice. Sonoran style eliminates the \"heat\" from the spices, but leaves the intense flavors. These flavorful selections are accompanied by one of the most extensive tequila lists in town, and all pair excellently with our Award Winning Margaritas. Our well-trained, knowledgeable staff will be happy to help you pick the right spirit to compliment you meal. Located on the corner of Chapel and Eastland Avenues, we are just a few minutes from Five Points. In addition our dining area, we have a large outdoor patio adorned with lights and colorful works of art. Rosepepper is more than authentic food and award winning margaritas; it is also an experience. We invite you to indulge your senses in bold Mexican flavors, vibrant colors and spirited fun.

The 1871 census lists a Thomas Dickason - Beer House Keeper, Newlands Tavern - the first of four Dickasons to run the place. The family's association with the pub came to an end in the early 1920s when it was taken over by Edgar Rhodes. After his death in 1941, his wife Elizabeth ran the pub until 1958. At some time during the Rhodes's tenure the pub was rebuilt. A Victorian photograph of the first tavern (right) shows a long two storey building; nevertheless brewery archives record that the pub in the 1920s was selling an impressive 800 brewer's barrels of beer per annum - over 600 pints a day! The exact date of the current building is uncertain, but may have been at the point when Edgar Rhodes's original lease with the brewery expired in 1936. The architect may have been A.E. Sewell, Truman's prolific in-house architect. The Ivy House owes its rather lonely situation at the brow of Stuart Road's slight hill to a German V1 bomb that crashed into the adjoining row of shops, in the afternoon of July 1st 1944, killing seventeen people. All the shops were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. When the war ended the celebration party was held in the pub, the surviving physical heart of the community. Long-standing local residents tell us that music and dance was often on the agenda throughout the 1950s and 1960s; however, it wasn't until 1972 that the Newlands really took off as a music venue, when the brewery offered a lease to Reg and Sue Fentiman, a young music-loving couple, with the proviso that use the backroom and stage in the same way that other pubs were doing in north London - this was the fledging pub-rock movement that paved the way for punk. The Fentimans dived into their task with relish. By the time they left in 1976, the pub had played host to such notables as Elvis Costello, Joe Strummer, Ian Dury, Dr Feelgood, Hugh Cornwall and Graham Parker. The latter has recently released a CD of a 1975 gig at the pub - Live at The Newlands ...","companyPhone":"+44 2072778233","companyRevenueIn000s":27966,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"education","displayName":"Education","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"education.training","displayName":"Training","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":false,"score":45},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":false,"score":45}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2021-06-21","topLevelIndustry":["Education"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":482352919,"companyIds":[482352919],"companyName":"Les Nouveaux Fermiers","location":{"Street":"51 Rue Du Mail","City":"Angers","State":"Pays de la Loire","Zip":"49100","CountryCode":"France"},"revenue":"$10.1 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":46,"employeesRange":"20 - 50","companyDomain":"www.lesnouveauxfermiers.com","website":"www.lesnouveauxfermiers.com","companyDescription":"Les Nouveaux Fermiers is a company that operates in the Restaurants industry.

The Gun boasts open fireplaces, a riverside terrace, two private dining rooms and an award winning kitchen serving excellent modern British cuisine. During the summer month we also open A Grelha at The Gun, a Portuguese BBQ right on the rivers edge. There has been a public house on the site of The Gun for over 250 years. The surrounding area was home to the dockside iron foundries which produced the guns for the Royal Naval fleets in the 18th and 19th centuries. The pub took its current name from the cannon which was fired to celebrate the opening of the West India Import Docks in 1802. In the late 18th century, Lord Horatio Nelson acquired a property just up the road (still known as Nelson's House) and he regularly visited the docks to inspect the guns up until his glorious death at the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Lord Nelson would frequent The Gun and regularly meet Lady Emma Hamilton in an upstairs room (now called The River Room) for their secret assignations. The Gun also has a long association with smugglers landing contraband on the site and distributing it via a hidden tunnel.

Just before the World War I began, Kavli began to produce more of the goods themselves, both canned and cheeses. In 1920, Kavli introduced Primula, a mild cheese with great durability (smelteost) . Today, the company sells produce in 30 countries from plants located in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, England and Scotland. After the death of his father in 1958, Knut Kavli (1890-1965) bought up most shares in the O. Kavli A / S. Kavli Foundation was created 25 April 1962, when Knut Kavli transferred his shares in the family company to the foundation. The purpose of the foundation is to provide funding for culture, science and charity. The foundations operations span twenty countries.","companyPhone":"+47 90894567","companyRevenueIn000s":16118,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-03-25","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":533099438,"companyIds":[533099438],"companyName":"Oceane De Proprete","location":{"Street":"Zac Erdre Active La Boulai 84 Rue Du Leinster","City":"La Chapelle-sur-Erdre","State":"Pays de la Loire","Zip":"44240","CountryCode":"France"},"revenue":"$22 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":119,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.oceane-proprete.fr","website":"www.oceane-proprete.fr","companyDescription":"Oceane De Proprete is a company that operates in the Restaurants industry.

Our philosophy is to enable everyone to have access to a range of holistic courses at a fair price and at a pace which will suit all the needs of our students in every part of the world. The Centre offers an exciting range of courses from the Foundation and Life Style level; to the full diploma programme for those who wish to take their studies further for either more advanced personal interest or to set up as a qualified therapist and then on to our advanced programmes. We also offer an amazing range of weekend tutorials to complement these programmes and, due to popular demand, we now offer workshops to non Kevala students. You can choose from a series of dates spread throughout your studies and decide which tutorials are the most suitable and relevant for your needs. These workshops are highly recommended but not compulsory for all of our students (sometimes geography gets in the way!)- although we have had students fly in from Japan!

After being inspired by classic French culinary traditions and techniques, she attained her goal, and graduated at the top of her class on the Deans list with a Perfect Attendance Award. Interested in forging an identity of her own, in 2004 Chef Lucia then began selling delicious signature confections, coffees, and exclusive teas locally in farmers markets. In 2012, she grew her passion and love of food into the corporate gift business, Lucia & Co., and it is in this venue that brings her the most satisfaction. \"Creating unique gourmet gift boxes and helping our clients nurture their client relationships is an extraordinarily gratifying endeavor, she says. I love hearing about the successes and growth our clients experience, the visibility they receive and how happy their clients are, really feeling so deeply appreciated. All this because of our little black gift boxes and the lasting impression of thoughtfulness they leave behind. Chef Lucia loves to share her passion with the world. You can find her as one of the featured chefs in Chefs Specials of California: Signature Dishes and Favorite Recipes from Celebrated Chefs and Restaurants Cookbook. In 2009 Chef Lucia was featured in a national Diet Coke commercial with award winning Chef Tom Colicchio of the hit TV show, Top Chef. In 2010 she was on the TLC reality show, Fabulous Cakes.

There is also a happy pun with the title Bel Ami, the novel by Guy de Maupassant, which amuses our French customers. Everyone else comes for the food and the wine list. The management of Bellamy's is made up of myself, Gavin Rankin (former Managing Director of the Annabel's Group when under the chairmanship of Mark Birley); Chef Stéphane Pacoud (former second Chef at Annabel's); and Manager Luigi Burgio (formerly Annabel's barman). The intention was to incorporate and modernise the best elements of the Franco Belgian tradition of the brasserie, although in Bellamy's there is less beer and rather more wine than was found in the original nineteenth century models. The design throughout was the brainchild of the architect and designer Tim Flynn, who spent some time in Paris researching brasserie decoration. He has produced a brilliant and fresh concept throughout with no attempt at hiding in retro clichés or other obvious shortcuts. Bellamy's is a Restaurant with an unashamedly French wine list, with familiar names at reasonable prices reflecting my own prejudices on the subject. There is also a weekly table d'hte menu which, at £ 24.75 for three courses, appeals both to the young and to the bit older who, like all the best parties, are happily united here. We also have a daytime Oyster and Sandwich Bar; and an evening Cocktail Bar. Most of our customers are regulars and some of them have been kind enough to describe us as 'a sort of club without a sub'. Membership is free and instantly open to all and, if you have not been here, we hope that you will join soon.","companyPhone":"+44 2088570197","companyRevenueIn000s":10310,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":4},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":4}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-05-11","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":507434789,"companyIds":[507434789,1284465133,457567858],"companyName":"KFC France","location":{"Street":"Boulevard Léon Blum","City":"Plaisir","Zip":"78370","CountryCode":"France"},"revenue":"$55.2 Million","revenueRange":"$50 mil. - $100 mil.","employees":332,"employeesRange":"250 - 500","companyDomain":"www.kfc.fr","website":"www.kfc.fr","companyDescription":"Kfc is a company that operates in the Restaurants industry.

The guys have been making music since the mid-1990s, and looking back on their career, frontman Jonathan Davis recalls the whole \"nu-metal\" label and how the Bakersfield, California, band got it. \"...In the beginning, in 1993 when we were doing this s***, '94 when it came out, we were not a metal band. A metal band was like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, and all due respect to them, that's what they were,\" Davis tells Kerrang! \"We weren't a metal band, and that's what they were trying to lump us in [with],\" Davis continues. \"They tried to stick us on all these different tours. I mean, we're opening for Pennywise and No Doubt. We're opening up for KMFDM. Just all these different bands, metal bands, and it just seemed like the metal community took us in.\" He added, \"And that was great, and we're doing our thing, and then all [the] little copycat bands started coming out. And then it became a movement, and then it became nu-metal.\" That said, it's all in the past, and Davis says that he simply doesn't care anymore. Moving forward, when it comes to the new album, Davis says it comes from a very personal place. \"It's a very dark record, it's basically all the stuff that happened to me last year, it's very emotional for me, but it is what it is,\" he said. His wife Deven passed away last year. \"I can't wait for people to hear it, I really spent a long time on doing what I wanted to do this time.\" In other news, Korn and Alice in Chains will embark on a co-headlining tour of North American this summer, beginning with a July 18 date in Del Valle, Texas. The tour will run through a Sept. 4 show in Mountain View, California.","companyPhone":"(816) 753-8665","companyRevenueIn000s":16730,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":30},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":30},{"name":"media","displayName":"Media & Internet","isPrimary":false,"score":20},{"name":"media.music","displayName":"Music Production & Services","isPrimary":false,"score":20}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Media & Internet"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":546686670,"companyIds":[546686670],"companyName":"Gusto Luxe","location":{"Street":"3f 258 Tong Ren Rd","City":"Shanghai","State":"Shanghai","Zip":"200040","CountryCode":"China"},"revenue":"$16.5 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":78,"employeesRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.gusto-luxe.com","website":"www.gusto-luxe.com","companyDescription":"Gusto Luxe is Asia's leading integrated luxury agency.

The geography we cover is much wider than I could ever have imagined when I set up the business aged 21. This is a fantastic achievement that wouldn't have been possible without our loyal employees new and old, and our excellent relationships with clients\"","companyPhone":"+44 8450509115","companyRevenueIn000s":25040,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":20},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":20}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":480376592,"companyIds":[480376592],"companyName":"Starplas","location":{"CountryCode":"Turkey"},"revenue":"$27.3 Million","revenueRange":"$25 mil. - $50 mil.","employees":151,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.starplas.com.tr","website":"www.starplas.com.tr","companyDescription":"Starplas is a company that operates in the Food & Beverages industry.

Firstly Promac (sister company of the great Rancillio) - based in Italy - produces robust, reliable equipment that uses the latest technologies to produce perfect espresso. Machines can be programmed to alert the user when to change water filters and also to book routine services after so many thousand espressos. You can choose also to have a milk temperature sensor that is a steam wand: it will foam perfect milk effortlessly without ever overheating the milk. The machines from Promac are all in the new kimbo colours: a special dark, rich brown gloss finish with discreet red KIMBO lettering. \"Because of the scale of our European operations with Promac, and our principal focus being to sell coffee, not machines, we can sell these machines very competitively - and often with free loan where volumes are over 150 coffees per day,\" explains Angus. Kimbo also has a strong connection to San Remo machines through the UK Barista Championships where San Remo is the principal sponsor and Angus is a qualified competition judge. \"I've seen some of the best baristas in the UK and they all swear by the technical and operational delivery of the San Remo equipment,\" he says. \"It is beyond doubt the machinery of champions. Although not many clients request this level of quality, it is vital we can support the request of those who are committed and serious enough to invest in the best. Where our clients are choosing from our Elite range of beans, San Remo equipment is a perfect partner.\" Also recognising budding coffee-at-home fans, Kimbo can now offer its pod and capsule machines for perfect espresso. The ingredients for these machines can be bought from Amazon grocery, keeping anyone's addiction fuelled! Kimbo's fabulous coffee is even available in the workplace throughout the UK now via a specially branded and calibrated N%W Astro vending machine from vending partner South West Vending.","companyPhone":"+39 800377977","companyRevenueIn000s":20504,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"mfg.food","displayName":"Food & Beverage","isPrimary":false,"score":30},{"name":"mfg","displayName":"Manufacturing","isPrimary":false,"score":30}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2019-09-24","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":482543000,"companyIds":[482543000],"companyName":"Arera","location":{"Street":"9 Via Crescenzio","City":"Rome","State":"Latium","CountryCode":"Italy"},"revenue":"$22.6 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":70,"employeesRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.arera.it","website":"www.arera.it","companyDescription":"Arera is a company that operates in the Internet industry.
