Since its humble origins as a single restaurant on Chung On Street in Tsuen Wan, Fairwood has forged a Hong Kong-wide reputation for quality and value and emerged as one of the city's leading fast food brands. Fairwood's journey to becoming a much-cherished Hong Kong institution was boosted in 1982, when we established a Central Food Processing Plant that gave us the ability to guarantee consistent food quality while also hugely improving the efficiency of our operations. Fairwood's popularity grew, and in October 1991 the Group successfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As a publicly listed company, Fairwood set out to stamp its mark on the fast food industry in Hong Kong and beyond. A major Fairwood rebranding campaign in 2003 saw us revamp our brand image, enhance our products and services, upgrade our employee engagement programmes and improve our operations and management practices. It all created a highly distinctive style and unique company philosophy that has served us well ever since, with continuing adjustments and redesigns over the years as we have expanded. Fairwood's constant quest to deliver quality food at affordable prices for every taste and dining preference has never flagged. Our fast food menu offers a strong range of both Chinese and Western dishes, with several signature products - such as Ah Wood curries, baked pork chop rice, spaghetti bolognaise, and sweetcorn and diced pork rice - that have proved universal favourites. More recently we have developed innovative new dishes to suit changing customer preferences, including our popular \"No MSG\" series, thick-cut black pork cutlet, claypot rice, and other claypot dishes. Our \"Tasty & Green\" and \"Wholesome Delight\" ranges cater for vegetarian and health-conscious diners, while the acquisition of our own Fairwood Bakery in 2021 has ...","companyPhone":"+852 28568632","companyRevenueIn000s":365301,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-09-19","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":33440371,"companyIds":[443621347,1232228802,33440371,1201315982,1204619073,343624047,370063822,475415358,401335498,375291861,1225620829,356954493,359632695,356827580,1275429776,397973364,343623852,417341428,457998477,374933252,373885404],"companyName":"Ruth's Hospitality Group","location":{"Street":"1030 W Canton Ave Ste 100","City":"Winter Park","State":"Florida","Zip":"32789","CountryCode":"United States"},"revenue":"$468 Million","revenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","employees":4527,"employeesRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.rhgi.com","website":"www.rhgi.com","companyDescription":"Ruths Hospitality Group, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, develops, operates, and franchises fine dining restaurants.

When Amaya opened its doors in June 2007, the idea was simple: demonstrate that Indian food served in a modern way could still stay true to its roots. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic Indian cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each guestfeatures that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. When we opened, there wasn't an industry category to describe what we were doing. After 10 years and with several Amaya Express locations, we compete in a category of dining now called \"fine-casual,\" the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry, where customers expect food quality that's more in line with full-service restaurants, coupled with the speed and convenience of fast food. Our focus has always been on using the kinds of higher-quality ingredients and cooking techniques used in Indian high-end restaurants to make great food accessible at reasonable prices. But our vision has evolved. While using a variety of fresh ingredients remains the foundation of our menu, we believe that \"fresh is not enough, anymore.\" Now we want to know where all of our ingredients come from, so that we can be sure they are as flavourful as possible while understanding the environmental and societal impact of our business. We visited Amaya Fairview Mall Location last week, food was great, freshly cooked and very tasty. The staff welcomed us with a smile and service overall was excellent. The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of mouth-watering food. Overall a good meal and great value we will certainly be going back. First time trying this place and I LOVE IT! The food was delicious, the flavours were perfect and for a lunch special the price is right.

The towns skyline is dominated by the ruins of St. Hildas Abbey, high on the East Cliff. Spreading below in the old town, a maze of alleyways and narrow streets run down to the busy quayside. The town has produced its own century explorer and voyager who had set sail in the Bark Endeavour from the harbour, the outstanding father and son whaling masters of the Scoresby family and pioneer photographer, Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. Whitby is a seaside town, port and civil parish in the Borough of Scarborough and English county of North Yorkshire. Whitby is situated on the east coast of Yorkshire facing the North Sea in a deep valley at the mouth of the River Esk. It has been a bridging point since at least medieval times and several bridges have spanned the river. The current bridge, built in 1908, is a swing bridge with a 75-foot span that separates the upper and lower harbours. The town is surrounded on its landward sides by the moorland of the North York Moors National Park and the North Sea abuts it on the seaward side. The coastal areas are designated part of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Heritage Coast. This stretch of coast, known as the Dinosaur Coast, the Fossil Coast or the Jurassic Coast, is around 35 miles long, stretching from Staithes in the north, to Flamborough Head in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

Assam Tea Company had to be either shut down or the company had to reinvent itself. Assam Tea Company reinvented itself. We continued to focus on importing and distributing Assam black teas. Today we have a sister company in Assam, through which we buy freshly harvested black tea every week and ship them to US & Canada via air and sea consignments. Today we also have a growing menu of blends using teas, herbs, spices and organic-compliant natural flavors. Our blends cover the entire range from Earl Greys to Chais and those without any extracts at all, Spa Blends. I have personally designed each and every blend over the last 17 years, and I continue to spend my days cupping teas to buy, and blending teas and herbs for my clients. I focus on using organic teas and herbs, and botanical extracts that are without any preservatives and synthetic solvents. These flavors derived from nature have a short shelf life, compared to synthetic flavors with preservatives, but once you taste them you will agree with me - they taste much better! Assam Tea Company mainly caters to coffee roasters, tea distributors, small brands, restaurants, coffee shops and other food service operators. We also have a strong following among tea drinkers who loves the taste of freshly harvested pure Assam black teas!

We have spent many years dedicated to the food and service industries. From our humble beginnings in 1991, in a florist shop, we transformed an old, rundown church building into a busy wedding chapel business. We needed the ability to prepare foods, for the wedding business, so we went to work once again, and took an old house we used for storage, and made it into a commercial kitchen, with individual dining rooms. Little did we know, we were about to jump into the restaurant business with vigor and enthusiasm. In 1999, we opened the full service restaurant and catering business, in the small, rural west Tennessee town of Troy. But with all of this, we felt the need for a place of our own to have larger banquets and receptions. In 2003, we designed and built The Moffat Centre in Troy. We discovered that we have a passion for providing great quality services and diverse products to this small rural community - services which typically are only found in larger cities. It was our desire to take this passion, and put it into a newer designed building, serving an upscale quality menu, in a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere and include a patio area, and bar. The opportunity presented itself, and once again we began planning the next phase of our business. In January of 2007, we assumed management and operations of The Quality Inn Banquet facility, housed within The Quality Inn Hotel, in Union City, Tennessee.

Since then, Bukhara Grill has offered New York a new dining experience with flavors of the long-forgotten Northwest frontiers of India.

In the style of a brew pub that crafts it's own Beer, we do the same but with Wine. Currently we are making a total of 6 wines right on the premises - for all to see. We're crafting 3 reds and 3 whites for sale only at Weinkeller. These wines are crafted using the juice of grapes from all around the world. Local farmers here in the Niagara region will be selected during the peak season for freshness and quality. We have built an environment that allows for a great visual and relaxed experience with prices that appeal to almost everyone. We offer a simply amazing menu using local Ontario grown product that will change seasonally to reflect what is at the peak of freshness. We have a very small freezer in our kitchen to ensure that the products we choose must be ordered fresh and that our ordering is in small batches to ensure quality and a fresh rotation. I am proud to have run out of a menu item that we have created fresh for that days service. It says that we care abut the quality of the product that we serve and that is prepared fresh everyday. Our menu is designed to feature a set price for a 3 course dinner or 5 course dinner - an entire experience at a set price. You're also welcome to order individually from the menu. It's your choice at Weinkeller, always. Wine, beer or a hi-ball may be substituted as a course as well to complete your experience. Check out our fresh menu selections in the menu section of the site. Why is it spelt that way? Weinkeller is the German word for Wine Cellar. As we are in a very old, bavarian hand carved, brick walled basement and are making wines, we thought the name was very appropriate. What was the motivation or idea behind Weinkeller?

Over the past decade, MR MIKES restaurants have embraced the heritage that was established back in 1960 and revitalized the brand by introducing the concept of SteakhouseCasual. That word sounds made up! shriek the masses. And youre right! Because no one has ever done it before. But thats how amazing things are created. Were sure when someone suggested the concept of bacon, people laughed. And now look how awesome bacon is! Inspired by their passion for great food and fun social gatherings, the term SteakhouseCasual was coined by the trifecta of entrepreneurs behind the modern MR MIKES brand: Mike Cordoba, Al Cave, and Robin Chakrabarti. Together, they created a place where people can connect through unique experiences driven by memorable moments on a platform of great food, ambiance, and Canadianocity (also a new word). And thats exactly what SteakhouseCasual is! The first MR MIKES was opened by two brothers, Bob and Nick Constabaris, who wanted nothing more than to offer an amazing steak dinner at an affordable price. Their goal was to establish a casual restaurant where everyone felt welcome. Those original values are something weve embraced and carried forward throughout the brands evolution. MR MIKES isnt just a pretty-looking restaurant with exceptional food, and the kind of ambience designed to rock your socks off. At its very core, MR MIKES is the experience, its the opportunity to take a break from the rigors of life, to share a drink with friends, to enjoy mouthwatering food that tantalizes the taste buds; a place where you can be you! We pride ourselves on being unstuffy, unpretentious, and unassuming. Pay us a visit at one of our many locations and discover for yourself just what its like to be Livin the MIKES Life!","companyPhone":"(604) 534-1100","companyRevenueIn000s":23848,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-11-14","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":130581388,"companyIds":[130581388],"companyName":"La Villa Restaurant","location":{"Street":"38 N Pulaski","City":"Chicago","State":"Illinois","Zip":"60641","CountryCode":"United States"},"revenue":"$14.2 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":78,"employeesRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.lavillabanquets.com","website":"www.lavillabanquets.com","companyDescription":"La Villa Restaurant provides top-notch Italian / American Cuisine.

(delivery area limits apply) Richard believed he was drawn to Calgary for a purpose and trusted that was where his family was meant to be. Not knowing where the next opportunity may lie and being faced with lifes challenges, Richard found his faith.

Richard always had a love for pizza and discovered that he could not find the quality of pizza that he was looking for. He wanted a thick but light crisp crust with plentiful and quality toppings.

That was the first spark that led to the creation of BC Tacos. He started to play around with different recipes, and different things that he would want to eat in tacos, and it just completely snowballed. One day Chiavari woke up, quit his job in Orlando and moved down to Ft. Lauderdale to open up a gourmet taco truck...and BC Tacos was born. Their philosophy is simple, they would like to invite people to BC Tacos to have something a little different: fresh, unique, gourmet tacos. They have a passion for food and service that shows when you arrive. Great food and great service are what they specialize in. They welcome you into a unique dining atmosphere accompanied with great flavors and something you will definitely be craving later. They appreciate their customers and thank them for choosing BC Tacos. They believe, and want you to realize, they are the best at what they do! With 12 different types of tacos on the menu, BC Tacos has something for everyone, from your standard steak and chicken tacos (which those have a unique twist to them as well) to your more unique, buffalo mahi and fried avocado tacos. The truck may be caveman themed, but they are bringing some of the best modern flavors, South Florida has to offer. After almost two years of taco slinging on wheels, Chiavari has started to expand the BC brand, and the menu, opening his first brick and mortar, BC Café,in April 2013. Its the same flavors and fast casual feel that you have come to expect from Chiavari and BC Tacos. The caveman themed restaurant features burgers, sliders, wraps, salads and of course tacos. Breakfast is available during the week, and you can find BC Café opened for dinner Friday and Saturday night. While Chiavari has enjoyed the next step, his journey is far from over and he is looking forward to the future with bigger things to come.","companyPhone":"(954) 801-4123","companyRevenueIn000s":16171,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":50}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2019-05-04","topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":48239211,"companyIds":[456782179,359496308,410616344,48239211,372407814],"companyName":"Chambre de la sécurité financière","location":{"Street":"2000 Avenue Mc Gill College 12TH Fl","City":"Montreal","State":"Quebec","Zip":"H3A 3H3","CountryCode":"Canada"},"revenue":"$22.5 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":137,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.chambresf.com","website":"www.chambresf.com","companyDescription":"Founded in 1998, The Chambre de la sécurité financire (English: Chamber of Financial Security) is a self-regulatory organization for representatives subject to Autorité des marchés financiers (Québec) distributing financial products and services, and Financial Planners of Quebec, Canada.

The guys have been making music since the mid-1990s, and looking back on their career, frontman Jonathan Davis recalls the whole \"nu-metal\" label and how the Bakersfield, California, band got it. \"...In the beginning, in 1993 when we were doing this s***, '94 when it came out, we were not a metal band. A metal band was like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, and all due respect to them, that's what they were,\" Davis tells Kerrang! \"We weren't a metal band, and that's what they were trying to lump us in [with],\" Davis continues. \"They tried to stick us on all these different tours. I mean, we're opening for Pennywise and No Doubt. We're opening up for KMFDM. Just all these different bands, metal bands, and it just seemed like the metal community took us in.\" He added, \"And that was great, and we're doing our thing, and then all [the] little copycat bands started coming out. And then it became a movement, and then it became nu-metal.\" That said, it's all in the past, and Davis says that he simply doesn't care anymore. Moving forward, when it comes to the new album, Davis says it comes from a very personal place. \"It's a very dark record, it's basically all the stuff that happened to me last year, it's very emotional for me, but it is what it is,\" he said. His wife Deven passed away last year. \"I can't wait for people to hear it, I really spent a long time on doing what I wanted to do this time.\" In other news, Korn and Alice in Chains will embark on a co-headlining tour of North American this summer, beginning with a July 18 date in Del Valle, Texas. The tour will run through a Sept. 4 show in Mountain View, California.","companyPhone":"(816) 753-8665","companyRevenueIn000s":16730,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":30},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":30},{"name":"media","displayName":"Media & Internet","isPrimary":false,"score":20},{"name":"media.music","displayName":"Music Production & Services","isPrimary":false,"score":20}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Media & Internet"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":81872189,"companyIds":[81872189],"companyName":"Macdonalds Restaurant","location":{"Street":"140 Atholl Rd","City":"Pitlochry","State":"Perth and Kinross","Zip":"PH16 5AG","CountryCode":"United Kingdom"},"revenue":"$15.2 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":81,"employeesRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.macdonalds-pitlochry.co.uk","website":"www.macdonalds-pitlochry.co.uk","companyDescription":"At Macdonalds Restaurant and Guest House we only serve the best quality local produce we can find, whether in our Restaurant or the Chippy.

On September 27, 1987, Fast Eddie's® was co-founded by Ted and Mike Gorski in the city of Brantford Ontario, at the municipal address of 9 Stanley Street. The business was originally structured as a father and son partnership. The windows opened, the cars started driving thru and the burgers were flying out faster than you could imagine. After all, Fast Eddie's® 100% pure beef burgers originally sold for sixty-nine (69 cents) everyday. Back then, everyday low prices were not common amongst the burger giants. Ted & Mike knew that their formula of high quality, fast service and extremely low prices would take them far and win them accolades amongst their true burger fans. Not surprisingly, their philosophy of quality, fast service and low prices still exists as the cornerstone of their commitment to \"Ultimate Customer Value\". Years and years have gone into developing and refining the Fast Eddie's® \"Speedy System\" and we can honestly say that we created what we consider to be the finest burger \"Turn-Key Franchise\" in the industry. Today, Fast Eddie's® offers \"Fast Service\" to it's customers in a \"Flashy\" little building specifically designed as a Twin Drive-Thru Restaurant. Customers may be served from either side of the building simultaneously. Fast Eddie's® has the \"Distinctive Advantage\" of two (2) order stations, two (2) separate drive thru lanes and two (2) separate serving windows. Our ability to take two orders simultaneously distinguishes us from our competition by allowing us to serve customers very quickly, often in 40 seconds or less. Fast Eddie's® menu is \"Uniquely Different\" consisting of high quality burgers, specialty fries and gourmet shakes. Fast Eddie's® fries come in five different flavors trademarked under the name \"CrazyFrys®\". Our milkshakes are \"Gourmet Style\" and come in several different flavors and are offered as \"WildShakes\". We also serve chicken burgers, soft drinks and specialty burgers called \"Sliders®\".

Serving Newfoundland & Labrador's finest fish and chips for over 60 years. Our history is part of our tradition. In 1951, Ches Barbour, with his wife Betty by his side, started a humble fish and chips shop in St. John's, Newfoundland. Rising each morning, he'd steam out the narrows of St. John's harbour in his small fishing boat, catch what he thought would get him through the day, and return to town in time to fillet and cook - opening the doors for the dinner time crowd and staying open late into the night. Through the years, Ches's family grew, and so did the business. Today Ches's is still a family-run business with seven locations in Newfoundland. But at the root of this business are the beliefs Ches practiced as a young man: treat your staff as your family; your customers as your friends; and, never forget that in Newfoundland, fish is more than a food, it's a staple worthy of the best treatment possible.
