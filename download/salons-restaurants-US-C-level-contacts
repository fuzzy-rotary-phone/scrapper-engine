In October 2017, the Company acquired 23 underperforming Pizza Hut restaurants in Kansas and Missouri. Utilizing a playbook developed by Victor over 25+ years working in a variety of roles at many different companies, Grand Mere transformed the management and store-level culture of its first stores, which resulted in a significant and rapid operational and financial turnaround. Capitalizing on these early successes, the Company grew rapidly and very quickly became a leading operator in Pizza Hut. Since then the Company has grown to become a leading franchisee in the system with nearly 150 stores and 3,000+ employees. Its restaurants are top performers in the Pizza Hut system across nearly all operational and financial metrics. Its founders and operational leaders are considered go-to tactical and strategic leaders across all facets of the system.","companyPhone":"(913) 383-8177","companyRevenueIn000s":105307,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":50}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isMasked":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"President, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder","jobTitle":"President, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder","isPast":"False","personID":3881874066,"profileImageURL":"https://storage.zoominfo.com/3881874066","firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Heutz","email":"victor.heutz@gmpizzahut.com","location":{"Street":"300 Park Ave Fl 12","City":"New York City","State":"New York","Zip":"10022","CountryCode":"United States"},"freeMails":["vheutz@comcast.net"],"mobilePhonesInfo":[{"number":"(516) 643-8909","count":1,"score":15}],"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-10-03","lastMentioned":"2022-10-03","confidenceScore":99,"noticeProvidedInfo":{"hasBeenNotified":true,"emailNoticeProvidedDate":"2022-02-02"},"name":"Victor Heutz","score":1,"mobilePhone":"(516) 643-8909","personalEmail":"vheutz@comcast.net","socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorheutz"}},"mobilePhoneIsDoNotCall":true,"certifications":[{"certificationName":"President, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder","organizationName":"Grand Mere Restaurant Group"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2020-07-09","positionStartDate":"2017-04-30","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true}],"companiesCount":1,"creditsPerTransaction":0,"view":true},

Since being founded in 1976 by Paul Hennessey, an entrepreneurial former Wall Street stock trader, Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. has grown from a single location in Hermosa Beach, Calif. into a diversified group spread throughout Southern California, the High Sierra's and Nevada that today includes: 16 Hennessey's Tavern and H.T Grill operations, as well as the renowned Lighthouse Cafe jazz club along with The Fish Bucket and Mickie Finnz Fish House & Bar - a casual \"beachy\" concept.

The final product, Mr Hennessey believes, is the traditional cozy or clubby feel indigenous to Irish or English pubs. \"I saw the need for nice gathering places with relaxing environments,\" Mr. Hennessey, referring to the Southern California market niche that he has captured and stamped with his own name. \"We have consciously shunned trends and gimmicks, and I think that is a large part of why we are still around, while so many of my competitiors have come and gone. Our restaurants are about our people. We ensure that our staff are more than just order takers or food deliverers. Our staff have become our extended family, along with our guests\".

With that, Noahs New York Bagels introduced the West Coast to high quality, fresh-baked New York-style bagels for the first time. At Noahs, we believe every bagel should be fresh-baked and that ingredients matter. Our dedication to quality includes cage-free eggs, thick-cut bacon, and bagels made of dough that starts with simple ingredients: flour, water, brown sugar, salt and yeast. We guarantee two things: first, a box of our fresh-baked bagels will be gone in a New York minute. Second, we are committed to serving food you feel good about eating, so that your best days start at Noahs. We know that coffee makes bagels even better. Thats why weve made our coffee even better. Now, all of Noahs Hot Brewed and Espresso coffee is small batch craft roasted, from the top 1% of the worlds beans and 100% Rainforest Alliance Certified. Noahs coffee is roasted by one of our roasters, one batch at a time. Throughout the process, our roasters utilize all of their senses. They listen to the coffee, smell it, watch its progression, and coax the beans through their journey from green to the perfect shades of brown we prize. Our coffee comes from the best Arabica coffee beans that are grown at an elevation above 3,500 feet, along the slopes of mountains around the world. Beans are hand-picked at their peak of ripeness, to deliver excellent and complex flavors. We are growing! In early 2017 our first of many new Noahs New York Bagels stores opened in Oakland, CA. We are proud of the new, contemporary store design that maintains Noahs iconic subway tiles and New York Heritage. Weve paired the new store look with our signature bagels and an entirely new menu of craft beverages on tap, including cold brew coffee, cold brew tea and kombucha.

Since being founded in 1976 by Paul Hennessey, an entrepreneurial former Wall Street stock trader, Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. has grown from a single location in Hermosa Beach, Calif. into a diversified group spread throughout Southern California, the High Sierra's and Nevada that today includes: 16 Hennessey's Tavern and H.T Grill operations, as well as the renowned Lighthouse Cafe jazz club along with The Fish Bucket and Mickie Finnz Fish House & Bar - a casual \"beachy\" concept. The company's sales have risen rapidly, as well, since its early days. Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. boasted total revenues for 2005 of approximately 32 million dollars. Mr. Hennessey credits the company's success to the fact that it has found a market niche and not deviated from it, even as Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. has continued to expand. He said he believes his dining and drinking establishments emphasize good food and ambience, but shun the flash-in-the-pan trends and gimmicks that are common among his competitiors. The final product, Mr Hennessey believes, is the traditional cozy or clubby feel indigenous to Irish or English pubs. \"I saw the need for nice gathering places with relaxing environments,\" Mr. Hennessey, referring to the Southern California market niche that he has captured and stamped with his own name. \"We have consciously shunned trends and gimmicks, and I think that is a large part of why we are still around, while so many of my competitiors have come and gone. Our restaurants are about our people. We ensure that our staff are more than just order takers or food deliverers. Our staff have become our extended family, along with our guests\".

With that, Noahs New York Bagels introduced the West Coast to high quality, fresh-baked New York-style bagels for the first time. At Noahs, we believe every bagel should be fresh-baked and that ingredients matter. Our dedication to quality includes cage-free eggs, thick-cut bacon, and bagels made of dough that starts with simple ingredients: flour, water, brown sugar, salt and yeast. We guarantee two things: first, a box of our fresh-baked bagels will be gone in a New York minute. Second, we are committed to serving food you feel good about eating, so that your best days start at Noahs. We know that coffee makes bagels even better. Thats why weve made our coffee even better. Now, all of Noahs Hot Brewed and Espresso coffee is small batch craft roasted, from the top 1% of the worlds beans and 100% Rainforest Alliance Certified. Noahs coffee is roasted by one of our roasters, one batch at a time. Throughout the process, our roasters utilize all of their senses. They listen to the coffee, smell it, watch its progression, and coax the beans through their journey from green to the perfect shades of brown we prize. Our coffee comes from the best Arabica coffee beans that are grown at an elevation above 3,500 feet, along the slopes of mountains around the world. Beans are hand-picked at their peak of ripeness, to deliver excellent and complex flavors. We are growing! In early 2017 our first of many new Noahs New York Bagels stores opened in Oakland, CA. We are proud of the new, contemporary store design that maintains Noahs iconic subway tiles and New York Heritage. Weve paired the new store look with our signature bagels and an entirely new menu of craft beverages on tap, including cold brew coffee, cold brew tea and kombucha.

Since being founded in 1976 by Paul Hennessey, an entrepreneurial former Wall Street stock trader, Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. has grown from a single location in Hermosa Beach, Calif. into a diversified group spread throughout Southern California, the High Sierra's and Nevada that today includes: 16 Hennessey's Tavern and H.T Grill operations, as well as the renowned Lighthouse Cafe jazz club along with The Fish Bucket and Mickie Finnz Fish House & Bar - a casual \"beachy\" concept. The company's sales have risen rapidly, as well, since its early days. Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. boasted total revenues for 2005 of approximately 32 million dollars. Mr. Hennessey credits the company's success to the fact that it has found a market niche and not deviated from it, even as Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. has continued to expand. He said he believes his dining and drinking establishments emphasize good food and ambience, but shun the flash-in-the-pan trends and gimmicks that are common among his competitiors. The final product, Mr Hennessey believes, is the traditional cozy or clubby feel indigenous to Irish or English pubs. \"I saw the need for nice gathering places with relaxing environments,\" Mr. Hennessey, referring to the Southern California market niche that he has captured and stamped with his own name. \"We have consciously shunned trends and gimmicks, and I think that is a large part of why we are still around, while so many of my competitiors have come and gone. Our restaurants are about our people. We ensure that our staff are more than just order takers or food deliverers. Our staff have become our extended family, along with our guests\".

Since being founded in 1976 by Paul Hennessey, an entrepreneurial former Wall Street stock trader, Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. has grown from a single location in Hermosa Beach, Calif. into a diversified group spread throughout Southern California, the High Sierra's and Nevada that today includes: 16 Hennessey's Tavern and H.T Grill operations, as well as the renowned Lighthouse Cafe jazz club along with The Fish Bucket and Mickie Finnz Fish House & Bar - a casual \"beachy\" concept.

Our restaurants are about our people. We ensure that our staff are more than just order takers or food deliverers. Our staff have become our extended family, along with our guests\".

Since being founded in 1976 by Paul Hennessey, an entrepreneurial former Wall Street stock trader, Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. has grown from a single location in Hermosa Beach, Calif. into a diversified group spread throughout Southern California, the High Sierra's and Nevada that today includes: 16 Hennessey's Tavern and H.T Grill operations, as well as the renowned Lighthouse Cafe jazz club along with The Fish Bucket and Mickie Finnz Fish House & Bar - a casual \"beachy\" concept.

Our restaurants are about our people. We ensure that our staff are more than just order takers or food deliverers. Our staff have become our extended family, along with our guests\".

Originally specializing only in sushi, Kikka has since expanded its menu to include a number of other delicious and popular Asian dishes such as Japanese tempura and Chinese noodle bowls, Korean staples like bibimbap, and even Indonesian and Vietnamese dishes. As CEO, Tonny Soesanto is very hands-on, participating in the evaluation, expansion, planning, and day-to-day operations of Kikka. From the day he founded Kikka until the present, he insists on the very best of everything for Kikka customers, from the quality of the product to the services they receive. Nothing is left to chance when it comes to the satisfaction of Kikka customers. Tonny received a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering at UC Berkeley, where he published a paper on fructose, sucrose, and glucose, and perfected his \"bear instincts\" - catching, cooking and eating fish.
