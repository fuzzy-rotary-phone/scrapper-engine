This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This sharp growth has proven its ability to duplicate its know-how and economic model. This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.

This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Regional President, French","jobTitle":"Regional President, French","isPast":"False","personID":9021423109,"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Hollister","location":{"CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-23","lastMentioned":"2022-12-23","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Stephanie Hollister","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-hollister-0b0212237"}},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Regional President, French","organizationName":"Dessange International"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-12-24","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true},{"companyID":65327806,"companyName":"Earls Restaurants","companyAddress":{"Street":"191 Main St","City":"Winnipeg","State":"Manitoba","Zip":"R3C 1A7","CountryCode":"Canada"},"companyRevenue":"$360.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":4798,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.earls.ca","website":"www.earls.ca","companyDescription":"Earls is a family owned premium casual dining chain that operates a total of 68 restaurants in Canada and the United States.
