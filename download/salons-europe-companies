This international network is founded on a master franchise system reserved for beauty professionals who receive assistance from DESSANGE International to roll out and develop the model in a foreign country. Master franchisees are genuine partners who set up and develop the full concept: upscale, hygienic and high-quality services and product distribution. They create their own networks of franchisees-affiliates to develop the three brands DESSANGE, CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams. They hire a training director and can open an advanced training center, like in Belgium, Italy, Austria, Lebanon, South Korea, Russia and Japan. They organize the distribution of hair and care products in salons. The layout and organization of the salons are tailored to each country's culture and customs. For the DESSANGE brand, DESSANGE International has privileged the opening of prestigious salons that systematically have a beauty institute. The development of CAMILLE Albane and Fantastic Sams in complementary market segments ensures greater organizational flexibility for the franchises. Product development is entrusted to local partners that have the capacities to adapt products to market trends. DESSANGE International enjoys close partnership relations with its master franchisees, who regularly hire employees with longstanding experience in the French network.","companyPhone":"+33 153839910","companyRevenueIn000s":130405,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-02-07","topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":399398220,"companyName":"Waves","location":{"Street":"Over Bølgen","City":"Greve","State":"Sjælland","Zip":"2670","CountryCode":"Denmark"},"revenue":"$351 Million","revenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","employees":1383,"employeesRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.waves-shopping.dk","website":"www.waves-shopping.dk","companyDescription":"WAVES Shoppingcenter i Greve, syd for København, byder p 110 butikker, lkre spisester, biograf og gratis parkering.

Today the company has evolved into a strong lifestyle brand, and as we continue to create our signature enamel pieces we are adding new categories to create full collections of luxury goods and fashion accessories. The craft of enameling on copper has been carried out in England since the 1740s. We still produce our hand-crafted signature enamel boxes in our own workshops located in the heart of England. Made by a team of highly skilled artists - using traditional English enamelling techniques handed down through generations - they continue to demonstrate the very best of British craftsmanship. Our craftsmen and artists take great pride in delivering luxury products of the highest standard. Halcyon Days creates a variety of hand-decorated enamel bangles. In our pursuit to continue the enamelling craft, we have translated the same process used for our signature hand-painted enamel boxes to create wearable fashion accessories. Our bangles are designed by our own artists and are made using the same traditional process as our enamel boxes. This ensures both design and quality is never compromised. We are proud to be one of only fifteen companies to hold all three Royal Warrants. This important relationship sets the high standard of UK craftsmanship and design, which we are dedicated to maintain. The United Kingdom, the United States of America and Japan are three of the strongest markets for Halcyon Days. Our key global accounts are Harrods and Harrods International, Fortnum & Mason, Scully & Scully in New York, Gumps in San Francisco and Isetan-Mitsukoshi in Tokyo. We are also represented in Canada, Italy, Switzerland, Russia, Singapore, Bermuda and the Caribbean, and we look forward to continued growth and development in other territories across the globe.","companyPhone":"+44 2037258001","companyRevenueIn000s":22284,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"retail.clothes","displayName":"Apparel & Accessories Retail","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"retail","displayName":"Retail","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":false,"score":30},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":false,"score":30}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2022-08-10","topLevelIndustry":["Retail"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":372672196,"companyName":"Aldo Coppola","location":{"Street":"336f Viale Sarca","City":"Milano","State":"Lombardy","Zip":"20126","CountryCode":"Italy"},"revenue":"$39.7 Million","revenueRange":"$25 mil. - $50 mil.","employees":203,"employeesRange":"100 - 250","companyDomain":"www.aldocoppola.com","website":"www.aldocoppola.com","companyDescription":"L'azienda nasce nel 1973 dal talento creativo e artistico di Aldo Coppola, un vero innovatore nel mondo dei capelli.","companyPhone":"+39 262499320","companyRevenueIn000s":39701,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":7},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":7}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2019-08-13","topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":469336516,"companyName":"Merz Aesthetics","location":{"CountryCode":"Russian Federation"},"revenue":"$302.2 Million","revenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","employees":1836,"employeesRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.merz.ru","website":"www.merz.ru","companyDescription":"Merz Aesthetics is a company that operates in the Hospital & Health Care industry.

At Taman, a prescriptive package is tailored in response to my clients individual needs encouraging self-connection which is ultimately restful and restorative. We live in a society which rewards busyness, being always available and always on yet this comes at a cost if we fail to carve out time to rest and recharge, to replenish our stores and to fill our own cup first. Taman Spa affords clients permission to take time for themselves, something we all need to do in this era of being constantly on. Blithn, the second eldest in a family of seven children, grew up only knowing that she wanted to help people.

Since then, weve never looked back and have set off to take the world by storm. Unlike many other shampoos which only wash dandruff away, CLEAR shampoos are engineered to not only remove dandruff flakes, but also boost your scalps natural self-defence**, ending recurring dandruff concern*. CLEARs revolutionary Triple Anti-Dandruff Technology is a ground breaking technology that combines scalp care and skin care. Enriched with upgraded Guar BB18 to enhance distribution of anti-dandruff protection on scalp barrier. CLEARs first non-antimicrobial ingredient, Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), it can boost your scalps natural defence. As well as with Amino Acid, it keeps scalp moisturised and healthy. With newfound Triple Anti-Dandruff Technology, it ends recurring dandruff concern, boosting your scalps fighting power. Unveil a stronger scalp defence with CLEAR. CLEAR understands that a mans scalp is different from a womans scalp. Seeing the need for a customised solution, CLEAR created the worlds first dual gender anti-dandruff shampoo. A mans scalp produces more sebum, having more loss of total protein and lower level of ceramide in their stratum corneum, making the male scalp barrier weaker, which makes it more prone to dandruff. CLEAR Men, formulated with Triple Anti-Dandruff Technology and Taurine, energises your scalps self-defence and helps restore the function of your scalp skin barrier. With its highly effective technology and formulation, CLEAR Men became the Worlds No.1 Mens Shampoo^ in 2009 and has strongly held onto the title ever since.","companyRevenueIn000s":96499,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Consumer Services"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":526915096,"companyName":"Safran Drogerie","location":{"Street":"31 Pfistergasse","City":"Luzern","State":"Lucerne","Zip":"6003","CountryCode":"Switzerland"},"revenue":"$81.1 Million","revenueRange":"$50 mil. - $100 mil.","employees":423,"employeesRange":"250 - 500","companyDomain":"www.safrandrogerie.ch","website":"www.safrandrogerie.ch","companyDescription":"Safran Drogerie AG is a company that operates in the Cosmetics industry.

This is why every Mahash salon has its own remarkable features and is different from any other salon. Depending on its specialization every Mahash salon provides a varying range of services unified by the brand philosophy and distinctive customer culture. Sometimes all you need is quick styling and manicure. But who said that you need to refuse yourself the pleasure of using natural products and accept services of lower quality? This is why the list of our services as well as the space of some salons is divided into 2 areas: the SPA zone, the area of immersion and solitude, and the salon itself filled with the air of sophistication and style. Natural materials used for decoration set the tone as you first enter the salon. But the deeper you immerse in the Mahash philosophy, the clearer is the idea that the concept of interior disappears and is substituted by the concept of atmosphere. If there were a specific barometer to measure the pressure of everyday life on your inner world, you would see that when you are at Mahash your soul is free from fuss and bustle. It may seem strange but this process starts right after the aroma journey which opens every treatment including the most sophisticated ones - hair styling, manicure of make-up. However, if you refuse it, out express services will still help you experience an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. SPA by Mahash is a touch of nature: all cosmetic products, substances and fragrances used in treatments are of natural origin, do not contain harmful ingredients and are environmentally friendly. Our skin care and massage practices are based on ayurvedic and eastern traditions supplemented by the latest innovation and beauty technologies. We rely on effective cosmetics and treatments, making no compromise with our conscience and staying true to nature.

Unser Team, bestehend aus rztinnen und rzten (sog. Prüfrzte ) sowie Studienassistentinnen (sog.

Die Haut ist unser grötes Organ, sie schützt unseren Körper vor schdlichen Umwelteinflüssen und reagiert sensibel auf Störungen. Diese können sich, bei entsprechender genetischer Veranlagung, als Hautkrankheiten wie Akne, Schuppenflechte oder Neurodermitis uern. Um das Gleichgewicht der Haut wiederherzustellen, sind oft Medikamente notwendig. Die Wirksamkeit der bisher zur Verfügung stehenden Substanzen ist hufig nicht ausreichend. Deshalb suchen Forschung und Wissenschaft fortlaufend nach neuen Wirkstoffen und Therapieanstzen, um die Behandlung von Hautkrankheiten zu verbessern. In klinischen Studien werden neue Therapiemöglichkeiten auf ihre Wirksamkeit und Sicherheit untersucht. SCIderm hat sich auf die Planung und Durchführung solcher Studien im Bereich der Dermatologie, Allergologie und Kosmetik spezialisiert. Ein Team aus ausgewiesenen Spezialisten unterschiedlichster Fachgebiete führt unsere Studien unter Berücksichtigung höchster Sicherheitsstandards durch.

Eine Versicherung bei einem Spezialmakler zu kaufen macht allein noch nicht gesünder. Da fast jeder Lebensplan unserer Kunden Geld erfordert, das durch Einsatz ihrer Arbeitskraft verdient wird, bieten wir Schutz vor den finanziellen Folgen einer Erkrankung. Krank zu werden ist schon eine neue Lage. Sie soll nicht zustzlich den Erkrankten und seine Familie in finanzielle Nöte bringen oder ihre Ziele scheitern lassen. Wir wissen, dass der Gesunde viele Ziele verfolgt, aber der Kranke sich als Erstes wünscht gesund zu werden. Daher machen wir Ihnen den Zugang zur besten Betreuung und Behandlung möglich. Dass unsere Kunden nicht zu viel ihres Budgets dafür ausgeben sich vor einem Ernstfall zu schützen ist unser Ziel. Wir halten am Markt im Auge, ob unser Kunde Gewinner eines Preiskampfes der Anbieter sein kann und prüfen für ihn, dass er weder unter- noch überversichert ist. Den maximalen Wert (=Maximum Value) Ihrer bereits früher abgeschlossenen Krankenversicherung erzeugen unsere Freunde der VerBESSERer für Sie ohne, dass Sie einen neuen Versicherer kennenlernen. Durch PolicenverBESSERung erzeugen die Tarifspezialisten eine VerBESSERung Ihres bestehenden Vertrages, wodurch Sie mehr Leistung von Ihrem Versicherer erhalten oder weniger Beitrag für Ihren Schutz zahlen.

Chapz Barbers' concept is to allow you to incorporate an excellent quality hair cut into your normal busy schedule. We are open 7 days a week allowing customers who work all week and don't find time on a Saturday, to avail of a Sunday option. Although most would consider a traditional barber to cater for men only, Chapz appreciate the fact that today's professional woman has a busy schedule, and for this reason, our skilled staff can look after our female customers. We cater for all hairstyles, cuts, and blow drying which is considered an art in itself. We also understand that ladies may only need a fringe trim from time to time and at Chapz you will not only get this fantastic service but at a very competitive price. We have active promotions, a free first hair cut certificate for your children and a loyalty card system in place. Most of our shops are located within Tesco Stores and this allows for ample free parking. Our unique location, also allows for a \"one stop shop\" for couples. While one is having their hair cut the other could be getting the weekly shop in. Chapz employ highly qualified staff, all of whom have a wealth of experience in both hairdressing and barbering. Our staff members specialize in understanding and recreating what you're looking for in a modern style hair cut. Chapz have countless satisfied customers who we find tend to return to us and stay. Our customer base is men, women and children and we like to pride ourselves on our ability to calm the little ones.

Naomi found her passion and now, 14 years on, Naomi has met thousands of client wishing to create bespoke permanent brows or a fuller lip through cosmetic tattooing. And many more for medical tattooing including Areola tattooing following breast reconstruction and follicle tattooing for hair loss caused by alopecia or male pattern baldness. Treating both men and women, the treatments and procedures Naomi offers range from permanent makeup for brows, lips and eyes, through to para-medical procedures such as scar revision, medical tattooing as well as scalp micro-pigmentation In 2015, Naomi decided it was the right time to move forward with her career and decided to open up her very own training academy. Naomi is the co-founder and Training Director of The Clinical Academy based in Portsmouth, UK. The academy specialises in delivering Permanent Makeup training, advanced and more medical procedures, as well as training for beauty therapy. My work is split between growing the Clinical Academy and running Naomi OHara Permanent Cosmetics. I wouldnt give either up, I love how diverse my work is. I am a people person and love to be around people whether that is by giving them a treatment they love or by coaching and helping someone with confidence within their training. I am very lucky to be able to do it all. If managing her time between running two businesses wasnt enough, Naomi, also personally teaches medical staff at The Royal Marsden Hospital in Para-Medical Tattooing and over the last few years has written qualifications in her subject for awarding bodies.

Hawkhurst itself is virtually two villagesone, the older of the two, consisting mainly of cottages clustered around a large triangular green known as the Moor, and the other, farther north on the main road, called Highgate. Each part has a different character. Highgate stands on a crossroads and is where the shops and hotels lie. The village was involved in the Wealden iron industry until the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th Century. William Penn, founder of the state of Pennsylvania, owned ironworks at Hawkhurst in the 17th century. The history of Hawkhurst goes back over 1,000 years. The oldest known settlement was the Saxon manor of Congehurst, which was burnt by the Danes in 893 AD. There is still a lane of this name to the east of the village. The name Hawkhurst is derived from Old English heafoc hyrst, meaning a wooded hill frequented by hawks - 'Hawk Wood'. Hurst (Hyrst) in a place name refers to a wood or wooded area - there are several in West Kent and East Sussex. The 11th Century Domesday Monacorum refers to it as Hawkashyrst, belonging to Battle Abbey. In 1254, the name was recorded as Hauekehurst; in 1278, it is often shown as Haukhurst; by 1610, it had changed to Hawkherst, which then evolved into the current spelling. Further information about the history of the village, its changing industries over the years and its famous inhabitants can be found here.

Schon immer habe ich es geliebt für Menschen da zu sein und Gutes zu tun. Die Leidenschaft einen medizinischen Beruf kombiniert mit dem Verwöhnen und Versorgen dürfen kann ich heute als Podologin voll anstreben. Anja Keller Whrend Anja Kellers groe Leidenschaft die medizinische Versorgung der Füe ist, bieten ihre Mitarbeiterinnen auch den Bereich kosmetische Fupflege, Wellnessmassagen, Kosmetik, Maniküre, Nagelmodellage, Tanning und Tiefenwrme an. Im Dezember 1991 schloss sie die Ausbildung zur med. Fupflegerin an der Inkofa Kosmetik- und Fupflegeschule in Münster ab. Seit 1992 arbeitet sie selbststndig auf Hausbesuchen und in der Praxis von ihrer Tante Annelie Meyer an der Landskrone. 1994 eröffnete sie ihre erste kleine Praxis in der Erlenstrae, die damals mit 4 Mitarbeiterinnen betrieben wurde. Schnell wurden die Rumlichkeiten zu klein und es musste über eine Vergröerung nachgedacht werden. So wurde 1999 unsere heutige Praxis am Galaxienring 2 gebaut, die im Mai 2000 als das heutige Wellness-Studio eröffnet wurde. Damals begann alles mit 7 Fachkrften. Im Jahr 2001 trat ein neues Gesetz das Podologen Gesetz in Kraft, so entschied Anja Keller sich noch einmal die Schulbank zu drücken um für ihre Patientinnen und Patienten gesetzlich und medizinisch auf dem neuesten Stand zu sein. Die staatliche Prüfung zur Podologin schloss sie 2003 im Mathias Spital in Rheine ab. 2005 eröffnete sie eine Praxis zwischen Ganderkesee und Delmenhorst in der Oase im Wichernstift. 2010 folgte die Kosmetische Praxis in Wildeshausen an der Heemstrae.

Bei der 1947 gegründeten Traditionsfirma Bahlmann in Barel sind insgesamt 12 Profis des Sanitr- und Heizungsbau-Handwerks beschftigt. Wir vereinen Funktionalitt und wohnlichen Stil mit der persönlichen Gestaltung Ihres Badezimmers. Das Badezimmer ist weit aus mehr als nur ein Ort der tglichen Körperpflege. Das Badezimmer ist ein sehr persönlicher und intimer Raum. Egal ob Gas-, Öl-, Pellet-, Holz-, Solar- oder Wrmepumpenheizung Wir helfen Ihnen dabei, das für Sie und ihre Immobilie passende Heizsystem bzw. die passende Systemkombination zu finden. Eine regelmige Wartung der Heizungsanlage und Durchführung der Feuerstttenschau ist nicht nur eine Sache der Vernunft, sondern sie ist auch gesetzlich vorgeschrieben. Wir machen das: ehrlich, kompetent und zuverlssig. Dafür stehen wir mit unserem Namen! Das Raumklima entscheidet darüber, ob Sie sich wohlfühlen oder nicht.

Ga dan voor de nieuwste technologie van Craithlab! Met ruim 40 jaar ervaring kunnen wij met recht zeggen dat wij bij Beauty Expert gespecialiseerd zijn in de beste behandelingen en producten. De kern van Anti Aging behandeling is het vertragen van het verouderingsproces. Rimpels ontstaan doordat de huid vanaf middelbare leeftijd dunner wordt en minder onderhuids bindweefsel, collageen en elastine wordt aangemaakt. Door roken en blootstellen van de zon wordt dit proces versnelt, gevolg rimpels, pigmentvlekken ( ouderdomsvlekken ) en vetophopingen.Bij Beauty Expert vullen wij het gat tussen de schoonheidssalon en de kliniek. Wilt u eens weten hoe het met de conditie van uw huid is gesteld? maak dan een afspraak voor een gratis intake en huidanalyse met onze professionele apparatuur. Wij verheugen ons met uw komst. Een supergoede salon, ik word hier altijd heerlijk in de watten gelegd en mijn speciale huid wordt hier tot in de puntjes verzorgd. Ik voel mij als herboren als ik hier vandaan kom. Complimenten aan Anouk, die altijd precies de juiste huid adviezen geeft! Floor Super! Vanaf baby altijd al heel erg veel last gehad van eczeem en de hoop al helemaal opgegeven. Dankzij Anouk heb ik nu een huid waar ik trots op ben! Echt een aanrader als je heerlijk wilt ontspannen of écht goed advies wilt over je huid! Lenneke Anita en Anouk, twee dames met een enorme kennis en passie voor hun vak. Op hun advies ben ik producten gaan gebruiken. Had echt nooit gedacht dat mijn huid daar zó van zou opknappen.

It replaced a small Anglo-Saxon monastery at Eynesbury in which were housed the bones of Saint Neot, a revered Cornish monk who died around 875. The Priory Centre stands on the banks of the River Great Ouse. It is a beautiful setting for a wedding or conference or just to take a break from shopping and enjoy a cappuchino or expresso. At night-time it comes alive with not to be missed shows and events which will have you singing and dancing the night away. Whether its a a big night out to see a live band or a Childrens play session youre after, the Priory Centre is the place to be. The Eatons Community Centre was officially opened in April 2010 by Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Gloucester GCVO. The Centre is located in Eaton Ford on the outskirts of St Neots with on site car parking. There are regular buses to the Centre from the Town.

In 2008 in the wake of the biggest economic crisis of our times our company went through a re-structure. We came to the realisation that the majority of our demographic were simply no longer able to afford Virgin Hair at the prices being set by other retailers. With vigorous market research and networking Love Hair began to distribute our products directly to the retail market. By sourcing our products direct we were able to set our prices much lower than other retailers. Love Hair's economically responsive approach of selling high end products at wholesale prices resulted in the company becoming amongst the countries leading Virgin Hair suppliers. As well as supplying Virgin Hair across the UK with stores in the three major cities of London, Manchester and Birmingham, Love Hair now supply within countries across Europe, Africa and America.","companyPhone":"+44 7940777004","companyRevenueIn000s":14559,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"retail.clothes","displayName":"Apparel & Accessories Retail","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"retail","displayName":"Retail","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"consumerservices.hairsalon","displayName":"Barber Shops & Beauty Salons","isPrimary":false,"score":45},{"name":"consumerservices","displayName":"Consumer Services","isPrimary":false,"score":45}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":true,"certificationDate":"2020-02-20","topLevelIndustry":["Retail"],"isDefunct":false,"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[]},{"companyID":533219878,"companyName":"Anja Krause","location":{"Street":"74 Göttinger St","City":"Hemmingen","State":"Niedersachsen","Zip":"30966","CountryCode":"Germany"},"revenue":"$14.7 Million","revenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","employees":75,"employeesRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.hautzeit-kosmetik-hemmingen.de","website":"www.hautzeit-kosmetik-hemmingen.de","companyDescription":"Mit dem lterwerden kommen die Fltchen.

Een haarstijl is daarom meer dan enkel een fashion statement het staat voor de symbolische uitdrukking van wie we zijn. Uw persoonlijke ervaring bij Inti speelt zich daarom af in een unieke, verheffende en verjongende sfeer. Alle aandacht gaat naar de co-creatie van uw kleur en uw stijl die het beste in u naar buiten brengt. De Inti ervaring staat voor sereniteit, aandacht voor detail en een perfecte savoir-faire die zelf-expressie en diepe rust stimuleert. Vandaar dat de Inti filosofie ook helder is: we focussen op het welzijn van zowel uw \"Hair & Soul\". Schoonheid, zachtaardigheid en zachtheid zijn de belangrijkste ingredinten van onze diensten voor onze klanten. De naam Inti draagt de verbinding met de zon in zich. De Inca's aanbaden Inti, de zon, die alle levensvormen op aarde voedt. Iedereen is ermee verbonden, ook wij, of we er ons nu bewust van zijn of niet. Bij Inti staat het \"Seed of Life\"-symbool voor het creatief aspect. Zaden zijn krachtige en magische dragers van de natuur. Ze bevatten de volledige intelligente blauwdrukken van het leven. Ze kunnen zeer lang in rusttoestand blijven totdat de factoren gunstig zijn om hen in leven te doen uitbarsten en schoonheid te laten creren. We passen dit bij Inti toe door zowel het milieu als onszelf te respecteren. Dit uit zich in zowel onze diensten naar klanten als in alle producten die we in het salon gebruiken en aanbieden.

Dabei steht die Langzeitwirkung im Vordergrund. Kurzfristige Effekte überlassen wir dabei gern den Kollegen von Film und Fernsehen - bei uns geht es darum, effizient und nachhaltig überzeugende sowie stimmige Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Synergetische Systeme und feinmolekulare Pflegesysteme haben sich dabei als effektiv erwiesen. Eine zielgerichtete Spezialbehandlung mit den Behandlungszielen Vorbeugen, Mindern und Straffen wird von uns für Sie individuell entwickelt und konsequent durchgeführt. Treatments, die bei uns im Behandlungsraum durchgeführt werden, können zu Hause mit genauso exakt abgestimmten Prparaten nahtlos fortgesetzt werden. Entspannen und Verwöhnen sind für uns in gleicher Weise wichtig und selbstverstndlich. Der Aufenthalt in unserer Praxis soll für Sie ein Ort der Ruhe & Entspannung sein. Schon Aristoteles (384-322 v.Chr.) sagte einmal: Nach Abschluss der Kosmetik- Fachschule und Ausbildung zur Einzelhandelskauffrau (Parfümfach) war ich 10 Jahre bei Douglas ttig.

Eine Ausbildung an der Lancome Visagistenschule sowie Ausbildungen in den Bereichen Permanent Make-up und humanmedizinische Pigmentierung kamen hinzu. Mein eigenes Kosmetikstudio leite ich nun bereits seit 2002. Noch immer sind stndige Fort- und Weiterbildungen für mich von entscheidender Wichtigkeit.

Een aanrader! Op zoek naar kappers die luisteren, goed advies geven en er alles aan doen om tot het perfecte resultaat komen? Stop je zoektocht want dit is alles wat Sanké Berchem doet! Ik ben al veel kappers afgegaan en telkens werd ik teleurgesteld tot vandaag. Het was mijn eerste keer bij Sanké Berchem en zeker niet mijn laatste! Ik ga nooit graag naar de kapper, maar na een bezoek aan Sanké Brasschaat ga ik steeds tevreden naar huis! Dat wil wat zeggen! Destijds mijn pruik gekocht. Ongelooflijk vriendelijke, professionele en discrete bediening. Alsook tijdens het onderhoud elke maand. Nu ga ik daar om mijn haar te kleuren en knippen. Geweldig goede sfeer, goede raad. Vriendelijk, tof team. Proficiat aan jullie allen!!! Opnieuw weer heel tevreden met mijn nieuwe kapsel! Saskia weet goed wat ze doet en ook de balayage is altijd top! Ook heb ik weer goed advies gekregen over haarproducten, zodat ik zelf thuis mijn haar ook goed kan verzorgen. Super tevreden van snit en kleuring! Gered door Sanké Leuven nadat mijn haar door zelf te kleuren een groene schijn had. Heel hard bedankt voor mijn prachtige haartjes, super content van!! Na een lange periode eindelijk terug naar de kapper, en het voelde als thuis komen. Zoals altijd een topservice, die met een glimlach wordt uitgevoerd. Laat je direct op je gemak voelen, en zeer professionele uitleg!! Binnenstappen met een klein hartje, buitenkomen met het kapsel waar je van droomde. Super tevreden van het resultaat en de kleuring.
