Selecting just the right wood for each application is important. Choosing the right glue or adhesive is also important, and nothing is more beautiful than a cabinet with shelves and drawers which PCS has created, but the true secret to a masterpiece lies in PCS's ability to understand how the piece or room is to be used. PCS listens to your thoughts and ideas, they measure, and they design a perfect creation. Once you have approved the piece, their skills, imagination, and excitement builds it in fine woods and imported hardware. PCS are artists with sawdust and cabinetmaker's glue under their fingernails, and a heart for wooden objects of beauty. We match both hard and soft wood veneers, then with the appropriate finish, be it the soft sheen of a hand rubbed wax or the bold character of a custom lacquer blended from a secret recipe formulated by a near forgotten Balkan craftsman's guild. With woodwork the finish is critical, sometimes what you see from across the expanse of the room isn't exactly what you see from a foot away. The closer you inspect, the more imperfections, runs, and foreign particles you find. Not the case with PCS, we create masterpieces in wood. If you are looking for exquisite cabinetry, moldings and furniture that are made to order and made to last generation after generation, we can deliver. All our cabinetmaking and millwork combines beautiful design with functional construction, factoring in affordability. Our cabinetry and millworking products continue to grow more beautiful over time, making your home, office or workshop a comfortable and warm place for years to come. PCS does the job right the first time. We take pride in treating you to the very best available workmanship, products, and the latest technology. We are a business that pays extreme attention to detail and on-time completion.

Robert Desjardins was a massage therapist for over 12 years and became frustrated by the lack of a supply store in the Alberta region. He founded and co-owned the first massage supply store in Alberta back in 1995. After selling this first venture Robert pursued his career as a flight attendant and massage therapist. Five years later Robert and co-owner Zara Mak felt there was a need for more choices and higher quality of products required by massage therapists, clinics and schools. Massage Essentials was then formed in 2000. Robert and Zara operate the store with the same values of caring for people that they held in their previous occupations. Massage Essentials provides excellence in service and products at a fair price to help massage therapists succeed in their practice. We focus on providing products made in Canada. Some of these suppliers/manufactures include: Maple Massage tables and accessories, Bio-Origin massage oils, gels etc., Gecko massage products, Lehcare analgesic cream, Motion Medicine and many more. Massage Essentials believes in giving back to the community. Local charities we donate to include: the Mustard Seed, Hope Mission and the Edmonton Food Bank. Samples, gift baskets and other supplies are donated to massage schools to help with fundraising, school orientations and grad ceremonies. Robert and Zara look forward to providing quality products and service to the massage therapy industry for years to come.
