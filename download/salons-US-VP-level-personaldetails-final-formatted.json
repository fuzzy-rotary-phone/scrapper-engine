Keep them motivated and keep communication open.\nPeople don't just stay for the money, they stay when they feel valued and appreciated.\"\n\nWith a dynamic and expert support system in place, the northeast is poised for tremendous growth . Carr explains, \"This is an emerging market for Sport Clips with the potential for exponential growth.\nBrand awareness continues to grow.\nThere are exciting opportunities for someone to come in and scale.\"\n\nCarr has worked with a variety of other franchise brands, so she has a unique perspective on what it takes to become a franchisee with Sport Clips.\n\" The selection process used to vet potential franchise candidates is unlike any I have seen in franchising.\nBeing so dedicated to franchisee success, the process is about really exploring whether this is a good fit, both ways.\nSport Clips takes the time to educate candidates.\nTransparency is important.\"\n\nCarr concludes, \"This is a great company to be a part of.\n",

A father himself, Warner is especially on the lookout for groups that promote athletics and other extracurricular activities for young women, he said. \"I do believe (athletics) are very important in the development of anyone, especially young women,' he said.\"They promote teamwork, partnering and preparing for the future.' Musical programs advocate much the same, he said. At age 22, Warner began his career with Avon in the operations department.Over the years, he has held a variety of positions, including division sales manager in Massachusetts and Philadelphia and regional sales director in Chicago. Some Avon outreach projects have been aimed at developing business skills in local residents. In 1999, Avon started small business training and development program through the Pasadena City College Community Development Center.Avon employees lecture on such issues as employer expectations, business Web site design, goal setting and how to run a retail business, according to the company. \"It gives them a real-world look at how you run a business,' said Avon spokeswoman Stephanie DuPre. Avon employees also volunteer for organizations aimed at children. It is the responsibility of good \"corporate citizens' to participate in such programs, Warner said. \"I think from a business standpoint, we want to be the company that is most respected and most admired for not only what we do for the community, but for what we stand for,' he said. On Friday, the company said it even wanted to boost the numbers of participants in its corporate leadership program. ",
