In 1987 they opened up a 1,500 square foot USDA factory called Ghiringhelli Brothers Pizza Company also located in Fairfax. Ten years later they journeyed over to San Pablo, Ca. and opened up a bigger facility. Shortly after that they became Ghiringhelli Specialty Foods and expanded their product lines to include fresh made salads and wraps. In 2008 they unveiled their new USDA facility in Vallejo, California. The company added a full line of artisan grilled chicken to their line up along with an ethnically diverse line of center of the plate entrees. Today the factory is at 55,000 square feet and a premiere provider of fresh foods for private label customers. The second generation of GSF, along with Mike and Ed, is helping to lead the way into the future. The original pizzeria is still going strong today, at the same location, and is being run by the second generation of family.","companyPhone":"(707) 561-7670","companyRevenueIn000s":36415,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"retail.grocery","displayName":"Grocery Retail","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"retail","displayName":"Retail","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":false,"score":45},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":false,"score":45}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Retail"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","jobTitle":"Chief Executive Officer","isPast":"False","personID":329116817,"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Ghiringhelli","phone":"(XXX)-XXX-XXXX","email":"XXXXX.XXXXXXX@XXXXX.XXX","location":{"Street":"101 Benicia Rd","City":"Vallejo","State":"California","Zip":"94590","CountryCode":"United States"},"mobilePhonesInfo":[{"number":"(415) 302-2706","count":1,"score":36.20402085434875,"latestDate":"3/30/2021 12:00 AM"},{"number":"(415) 302-0318","latestDate":"10/3/2018 5:00 AM"}],"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-08","lastMentioned":"2022-12-08","confidenceScore":99,"noticeProvidedInfo":{"hasBeenNotified":true,"emailNoticeProvidedDate":"2022-08-30"},"name":"Mike Ghiringhelli","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"mobilePhone":"(XXX)-XXX-XXXX","socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mike-ghiringhelli/13/179/4b5"}},"privacyRegulationFlags":{"privacyRegulationFlag":"california"},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Chief Executive Officer","organizationName":"Ghiringhelli Specialty Foods"}],"isEU":false,"buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true,"publicSourcedData":[{"urls":["http://gfoods.net/","http://gfoods.net/about-us/","http://gfoods.net/contact-2/"],"dataType":"WORK_EMAIL"}],"icpScore":5},{"companyID":76711901,"companyName":"Mina Group","companyAddress":{"Street":"244 California St","City":"San Francisco","State":"California","Zip":"94111","CountryCode":"United States"},"companyRevenue":"$445.5 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$250 mil. - $500 mil.","companyEmployees":2500,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"1,000 - 5,000","companyDomain":"www.michaelmina.net","website":"www.michaelmina.net","companyDescription":"Founded in 2002 and Headquartered in San Francisco, California.

We like to think of Amnesia as a vessel. A working ship, maybe. Not the prettiest boat in the harbor, but she's got stories. She's sees more action in a week than others will see in a lifetime. Her hold is filled with experiences and, despite her name, her memory is strong. She remembers every undulation on the dance floor, every scream, every solo, every laugh and tear, and every shout for encores. What happens in here? This is the little neighborhood bar that could. We host great entertainment every night of the week, from acoustic-folk to electro-disco. We have no boundaries where music is concerned, as long as we think it will help to create the most positive experience possible. lthough every night has something amazing, shocking, or inspiring going on, we do host a few nights that have stood the test of time and become staples in this fair city: Monday night is our Bluegrass night, where you can kick up yer boots and get rowdy to some hillbilly sounds from local and nationally touring bands. We have been a hub for Bay Area bluegrass bands for 8 years running and have been lucky enough to have bluegrass greats such as The Dillards, Del McCoury, Butch Waller, and David Grisman pass through our doors. (okay, so Del didn't actually play, but he did have a good time). Wednesdays is our jazz night. Starting off with Gaucho, the de facto hot club of Amnesia, you will be transported to a 1930s parisian cafe minus the accents and cigarette smoke. Bodies will be twirling, feet will be tapping, drinks will be had, you will probably smile. After Gaucho steps off the stage, the jazzers take over with a late-night straight-ahead jam session hosted by Michael Abraham. Bring an instrument if you can hang, or just sit there and be amazed and moved by sounds coming off the stage.","companyPhone":"(415) 970-0012","companyRevenueIn000s":13263,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"bizservice.marketing","displayName":"Advertising & Marketing","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"bizservice","displayName":"Business Services","isPrimary":true,"score":100},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":false,"score":30},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":false,"score":30}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Business Services"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder","jobTitle":"Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder","isPast":"False","personID":1938781284,"firstName":"Courtney","lastName":"Wu","email":"XXXXX.XXXXXXX@XXXXX.XXX","location":{"Street":"1450 Sutter Ave 112","City":"San Francisco","State":"California","Zip":"94109","CountryCode":"United States"},"mobilePhonesInfo":[{"number":"(415) 769-8852","count":2,"score":44.2705365469149,"latestDate":"3/30/2020 12:00 AM"}],"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-10-06","lastMentioned":"2022-10-06","confidenceScore":98,"name":"Courtney Wu","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"mobilePhone":"(XXX)-XXX-XXXX","socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtney-wu-59a76127"}},"privacyRegulationFlags":{"privacyRegulationFlag":"california"},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder","organizationName":"Amnesia"}],"isEU":false,"positionStartDate":"2018-09-30","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true,"icpScore":5},{"companyID":38749161,"companyName":"Ozumo","companyAddress":{"Street":"161 Steuart St","City":"San Francisco","State":"California","Zip":"94105","CountryCode":"United States"},"companyRevenue":"$15.8 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","companyEmployees":86,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.ozumo.com","website":"www.ozumo.com","companyDescription":"Ozumo Concepts International, LLC (\"OCI\") is the premier operator of contemporary Japanese cuisine and has built a successful 10 year track-record with its flagship Ozumo restaurant based in San Francisco.

SusieCakes' promise is to bake the best-tasting, timeless versions of your most-loved treats. All locations are company owned and founder led. SusieCakes' founder, Susan Sarich, grew up in Chicago, where she was called Susie by her two beloved grandmothers, Mildred and Madeline. Every day Susie would come home from school to enjoy her grandmothers' company over a glass of milk and a fresh-baked treat. This daily baking ritual and special time together in the kitchen left a lasting impression. When Susie grew up and moved to the West Coast, she brought along her grandmothers' carefully recorded recipes on handwritten 3x5 cards. This pure and simple connection to those recipes inspired Susan to create SusieCakes bakeries, and to share her childhood experience with others. Through SusieCakes, Susan honors her grandmothers: both in her dedication to their baking traditions and her commitment to providing women with progressive careers in the food & hospitality industry. Today, SusieCakes is proud to share that women account for over 80 percent of the SusieCakes team.","companyPhone":"(818) 591-2223","companyRevenueIn000s":16900,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"mfg.food","displayName":"Food & Beverage","isPrimary":true,"score":45},{"name":"mfg","displayName":"Manufacturing","isPrimary":true,"score":45},{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":false,"score":17},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":false,"score":17}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"Founder & Chief Executive Officer","jobTitle":"Founder & Chief Executive Officer","isPast":"False","personID":214595388,"profileImageURL":"http://www.diablomag.com/Susan-Sarich.jpg","firstName":"Susan","lastName":"Sarich","phone":"(XXX)-XXX-XXXX","email":"XXXXX.XXXXXXX@XXXXX.XXX","location":{"City":"San Francisco","State":"California","CountryCode":"United States"},"mobilePhonesInfo":[{"number":"(312) 953-3334","latestDate":"10/3/2018 5:00 AM"}],"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-09-12","lastMentioned":"2022-09-12","confidenceScore":92,"noticeProvidedInfo":{"hasBeenNotified":true,"emailNoticeProvidedDate":"2020-01-05"},"name":"Susan Sarich","score":1,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"mobilePhone":"(XXX)-XXX-XXXX","socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/susan-sarich/63/2b4/52a"}},"mobilePhoneIsDoNotCall":true,"privacyRegulationFlags":{"privacyRegulationFlag":"california"},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"Founder & Chief Executive Officer","organizationName":"SusieCakes"}],"isEU":false,"buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true,"icpScore":5},{"companyID":358216823,"companyName":"Kinder's Meats","companyAddress":{"Street":"1369 East Ave","City":"Chico","State":"California","Zip":"95926","CountryCode":"United States"},"companyRevenue":"$19 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","companyEmployees":97,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.kindersmeats.com","website":"www.kindersmeats.com","companyDescription":"Since 1946, Kinder's (www.kindersmeats.com) has been a popular neighborhood meat market, deli and catering company.

In addition to ordering off the truck during private events, Sam's serves authentic New England style Lobster Clambakes for groups, which is a delicious seafood feast as well as an exciting event. Nationally known Executive Chef/Partner Lewis Rossman, directs all food and kitchen activities. His seafood earned Sam's \"Culinary Hospitality Restaurant of the Year\" by Sante Magazine, a feature in Gourmet Magazine, and he's been featured on \"Best of the Bay\" TV. Whether you need a quick and delicious lunch, or a three course Lobster Clambake on the beach, Sam's ChowderMobile will bring the party to you.Visit our website to see our schedule of locations, menu and specials.

Skipolini's was founded on a very simple credo; Provide high quality food in a unique, family friendly environment, at affordable prices. The success of the restaurant over the past three decades has been largely attributed to its steadfast commitment to this business philosophy. Current owner, Kent Ipsen (son of Bev and Skip) began working in the restaurant at the mature age of nine. After graduating College, he and his wife, Yvette opened a Skipolini's Pizza in Antioch, California with the blessing of his parents. Shortly thereafter, Bev and Skip wished to retire, and the original Skipolini's went up for sale. In 1994, Kent and Yvette purchased the Clayton restaurant and then opened the Walnut Creek and Concord locations were opened in 1999 and 2007 respectively. Over the years the restaurants have continued to cater to the needs of the families that patronize them. Most locations boast a play structure and an assortment of toys for our younger patrons. In this environment, parents get the opportunity to enjoy one another and discuss the day's events while the children are hard at play. All of the restaurants have inside and outside dining which provides for a unique family atmosphere. Though Skipolini's has always been known for its friendly service and award winning food, its greatest claim to fame has been our \"Prego Pizza\", the pizza that induces labor in expecting mothers.

The blending of these cultures mixed with Perus unusually large number of climate changes due to its many geological difference, combined with its unique, indigenous agriculture is what gives Peruvian cuisine its edge and makes it some of the best cuisines from around the world. Offering a taste through Peru, La Mars signature menu items range from unique seafood, meat, and vegetarian selections that showcase Chef Lopezs dedication to sea-to-table cooking. Vibrant dish examples include the Cebiche Clsico with California halibut in a classic leche de tigre with red onion, habanero, Peruvian corn, and yam, and Tiradito Gastón with Peruvian bay scallops and creamy aj amarillo leche de tigre. Pulling further inspiration from Peru, the menu offers Peruvian classics including the Causa, a duo of whipped potatoes topped with seafood or vegetables, and Lomo Saltado, a Traditional Peruvian-style stir-fry of beef tenderloin, sautéed with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, garlic, and soy sauce, topped with a fried egg, papas fritas, and rice. Going beyond the classics, Chef Lopez creates colorful, fresh, and healthy dishes that cater to both gluten-free and vegan diners. La Mars cocktail menu is built around Pisco, the national drink of Peru, and goes beyond the classics like the Pisco Sour to feature a dozen specialized cocktails including the Chilcano with Pisco, ginger beer, lime juice, and angostura bitters. Traditional Peruvian beverages such as Chicha Morada, made of purple corn, spices, and fruit, and Inca Kola provide a non-alcoholic alternative. Located inside the historic Pier 1, La Mars clean minimalist décor preserves the beauty of the old building while also adding splashes of blue and green accents to fit with the seafood-focused menu.","companyPhone":"(415) 397-8880","companyRevenueIn000s":12734,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":14},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":14}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"General Manager","jobTitle":"General Manager","isPast":"False","personID":2046304350,"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Medl","phone":"(XXX)-XXX-XXXX","email":"XXXXX.XXXXXXX@XXXXX.XXX","location":{"Street":"5 The Embarcadero","City":"San Francisco","State":"California","Zip":"94111","CountryCode":"United States"},"freeMails":["tmmedl@gmail.com"],"mobilePhonesInfo":[{"number":"(615) 557-8600","count":1,"score":0.6984932149947921,"latestDate":"4/20/2020 5:00 AM"}],"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-11-16","lastMentioned":"2022-11-16","confidenceScore":95,"noticeProvidedInfo":{"hasBeenNotified":true,"emailNoticeProvidedDate":"2020-01-07"},"name":"Thomas Medl","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"mobilePhone":"(XXX)-XXX-XXXX","personalEmail":"XXXXX.XXXXXXX@XXXXX.XXX","socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-medl-25162249"}},"mobilePhoneIsDoNotCall":true,"privacyRegulationFlags":{"privacyRegulationFlag":"california"},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"General Manager","organizationName":"La Mar"}],"isEU":false,"positionStartDate":"2014-12-31","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true,"icpScore":5},{"companyID":346662224,"companyName":"The Taco Shop","companyAddress":{"Street":"1824 Irving St","City":"San Francisco","State":"California","Zip":"94122","CountryCode":"United States"},"companyRevenue":"$17 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$10 mil. - $25 mil.","companyEmployees":58,"companyEmployeeCountRange":"50 - 100","companyDomain":"www.underdogstres.com","website":"www.underdogstres.com","companyDescription":"\"Here at The Taco Shop we are committed to using the finest ingredients available.

The bar was topped with copper, allowing the beer taps to glow in front of a huge wooden ice box. Founder John Martin was already an established named in craft beer in the early 90s, having started Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse, the country's oldest original brewpub, in 1986 & working tirelessly to improve brewing legislation. His focus on sculpting the perfect customer experience was built directly into everything Jupiter is. Nearly 25 years later, Jupiter is still a Berkeley hotspot. Dinner here is a bronze-hued buzz, almost always saturated with Berkeley folk, old & new. Customers are greeted with the smell of pizza dough & roasted toppings the moment they walk through the door. Any open seats at the bar draw beer lovers & learners alike to interact with our highly-trained bar staff, receiving recommendations on new finds or old classics. Jupiter hosts live music on our outdoor patio up to 6 nights a week.

The two-story venue was designed to emanate gothic-influence: metallic pressed tin on the walls, pews salvaged from St. John's Presbyterian (now the Julia Morgan Theatre) & antique church lighting. The bar was topped with copper, allowing the beer taps to glow in front of a huge wooden ice box. Founder John Martin was already an established named in craft beer in the early 90s, having started Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse, the country's oldest original brewpub, in 1986 & working tirelessly to improve brewing legislation. His focus on sculpting the perfect customer experience was built directly into everything Jupiter is. Nearly 25 years later, Jupiter is still a Berkeley hotspot. Dinner here is a bronze-hued buzz, almost always saturated with Berkeley folk, old & new. Customers are greeted with the smell of pizza dough & roasted toppings the moment they walk through the door. Any open seats at the bar draw beer lovers & learners alike to interact with our highly-trained bar staff, receiving recommendations on new finds or old classics. Jupiter hosts live music on our outdoor patio up to 6 nights a week. Trumpet vines & string lights create rare atmosphere in this truly unique Downtown oasis.","companyPhone":"(510) 843-8277","companyRevenueIn000s":20000,"doziIndustry":[{"name":"hospitality","displayName":"Hospitality","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"hospitality.restaurant","displayName":"Restaurants","isPrimary":true,"score":50},{"name":"construction.construction","displayName":"Commercial & Residential Construction","isPrimary":false,"score":40},{"name":"construction","displayName":"Construction","isPrimary":false,"score":40}],"companyType":"PRIVATE","certified":false,"topLevelIndustry":["Hospitality"],"isMasked":true,"isTagged":false,"subscribed":false,"title":"General Manager","jobTitle":"General Manager","isPast":"False","personID":8651799529,"firstName":"Samy","lastName":"Ali","location":{"City":"San Francisco","State":"California","CountryCode":"United States"},"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-12-02","lastMentioned":"2022-12-02","confidenceScore":91,"name":"Samy Ali","score":0,"universalTagged":[],"orgUniversalTagged":[],"socialUrls":{"socialMedia":{"socialNetworkType":"linkedin.com","socialNetworkUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samy-ali-b6642a103"}},"privacyRegulationFlags":{"privacyRegulationFlag":"california"},"certifications":[{"certificationName":"General Manager","organizationName":"Jupiter"}],"isEU":false,"creationDate":"2022-11-19","buyingCommittee":false,"hasOnlinePresence":true,"icpScore":5},{"companyID":124354993,"companyName":"Westfield San Francisco Centre","companyAddress":{"Street":"865 Market St","City":"San Francisco","State":"California","Zip":"94103","CountryCode":"United States"},"companyRevenue":"$58.9 Million","companyRevenueRange":"$50 mil. -
